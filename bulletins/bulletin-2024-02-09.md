Whether it is carpentry, auto mechanics, electrical engineering, or computer science, you always hear the same saying: use the right tool for the right job. The wrong tool can make any solution difficult and could introduce new problems. I&#39;ve previously written about some of the big problems with the C2PA solution for recording provenance and authenticity in media. However, I recently came across a new problem based on their decision to use X.509 certificates and how they are used. X.509 format.

The leaked user database shows one of the forum&#39;s founders was an attorney who advised Russia&#39;s top hackers on the legal risks of their work, and what to do if they got caught. A review of this user&#39;s hacker identities shows that during his time on the forums he served as an officer in the special forces of the GRU, the foreign military intelligence agency of the Russian Federation.

Distributed consensus in transactional databases (e.g. etcd or Cockroach) is a big deal these days. Most often under the hood are variations of log-based Paxos-like algorithms such as MultiPaxos, Viewstamped Replication, or Raft. While there are new variations that come out each year, optimizing for various workloads, these algorithms are fairly standard and well-understood. What happens as you tweak a configuration. What happens as the production environment changes. And so on. They are not.co.

## [Cross compiling Rust to win32](https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2024/02/cross-compile.html)


This post is part of a series on retrowin32 . In retrowin32 I sometimes want to make my own win32 programs that I can run either natively or through the emulator to compare behaviors. The first time I wrote about this I tried Zig, found it promising, but gave up and used C. The second time I tried Zig again and had a good time but also wrote about downsides. The bulk of retrowin32 is written in Rust, so an obvious question is why I haven&#39;t used Rust for this purpose...exe to link.g.dll ...

## [Design and Analysis of a Logless Dynamic Reconfiguration Protocol](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/02/design-and-analysis-of-logless-dynamic.html)


This paper appeared in OPODIS&#39;21 and describes dynamic reconfiguration in MongoDB. So, what is dynamic reconfiguration? The core Raft protocol implements state machine replication (SMR) using a static set of servers. ( Please read this to learn about how MongoDB adopted Raft for a pull-based SMR .) To ensure availability in the presence of faults, SMR systems must be able to dynamically (and safely) replace failed nodes with healthy ones. This is known as dynamic reconfiguration.e.g.e.m,C&#39;.m).m.

Is there a growing gender gap in the U.S? Alignment A recent article in the Financial Times suggests that among young people there is a growing gender gap in political alignment on a spectrum from liberal to conservative. In last week’s post, I tried to replicate this result using data from the General Social Survey. I generated the following figure, which shows the percentage of liberals minus the percentage of conservatives from 1988 to 2021, among people 18 to 29... Read More Read More

I have a couple of fancy Dyson fans that do cooling (or at least blowing air around) and heating. They use a little IR remote control that attaches to the top with magnets. One of the remotes decided to stop working; its failure mode was: consume an entire CR2032 battery in a few days. Apparently, I&#39;m not alone in experiencing this problem. Here&#39;s the little circuit board inside. The pads are the underside of the buttons.5kΩ when I was expecting it to be very, very high or even infinite.2mA.

A hash function maps values (e.g., strings) into a fixed number of strings, typically smaller than the original. It is useful to compare quickly two long strings, for example. Instead of comparing the strings, you may compare the hash values. A simple hash function consists in repeatedly multiplying the hash value by some constant B … Continue reading How fast is rolling Karp-Rabin hashing?

This article discusses how to optimize Rust builds. Earthly significantly speeds up Rust build times. Learn more . Rust is a powerful and expressive programming language that offers many benefits, including memory safety, performance, and concurrency. However, Rust is also known for being slow to compile, especially for large and complex projects. This can frustrate developers who want to iterate quickly and test their code. This can speed up the build process by avoiding unnecessary work.

Over the last few years, there has been a backlash against what is commonly called “Hustle Culture” — burning the midnight oil and working seven days a week to achieve a desired outcome. Hustle culture is undoubtedly unhealthy and can lead to burnout, yet sometimes, if you want to accomplish something big, the only way it will happen is to put the hours in. Apple’s first operating system and Microsoft Windows weren’t created by people working nine to five hours and resting on the weekends.

Spring Framework 6.1 and Spring Boot 3.2 run on Java 21. They make concurrent programming simpler and more efficient with virtual threads, as well as improving reactive programming and Kotlin coroutines. For “Scale to Zero” startup time reduction, the OpenJDK project CRaC received initial support, while the existing GraalVM Native Image integration got faster through a GraalVM release.

In november 2023 was ik de gast-columnist van de Volkskrant, en heb ik vier stukjes geschreven die steeds op zondag (alleen online) verschenen. Dit was voor mij voor het eerst dat ik echt iedere week moest ’leveren’, en ook nog binnen heldere kaders: 700 woorden, opinie over dingen die al in het nieuws geweest zijn. Ik heb nu een nieuw respect voor de columnisten die zoiets iedere week weer kunnen, en tegelijk zie ik ook dat niet iedereen wekelijks een topprestatie kan leveren.
