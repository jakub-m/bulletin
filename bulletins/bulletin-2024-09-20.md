In short: use with_suffix . For example, Path(&#34;foo.txt&#34;).with_suffix(&#34;.ogg&#34;) == Path(&#34;foo.ogg&#34;) . I recently had a Python pathlib.Path whose extension I wanted to change. For example, I wanted to change Path(&#34;foo.txt&#34;) to Path(&#34;foo.ogg&#34;) . I did this by using the with_suffix method . For example: from pathlib import Path my_path = Path( &#34;/foo/bar.txt&#34; ) my_path.with_suffix( &#34;.ogg&#34; ) # =&gt; Path(&#34;/foo/bar.ogg&#34;) I hope this post helps the next person who wanted to do this!

Large Language Models (LLMs) are often unpredictable and hard to control in practice. For example, a model can perform well during testing but fail in production, leading to inconsistent outputs or hallucinations. This unpredictability is intrinsic to the stochastic nature of LLMs: they can produce different results for the same input, making it impossible to…

I was recently reviewing the Japanese building footprint data in Overture&#39;s August release and came across a large gap of buildings in Zushi, a town one hour&#39;s drive south of central Tokyo. I mentioned the gap on LinkedIn and had several replies. One suggestion was to look at the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan&#39;s site for building footprint data. While I did find data for Zushi, it was point data for each building rather than polygons of their footprints.1 GHz . $ virtualenv ~/.0.38.0.

And why it matters today. For years, I believed that to become more productive, I had to find a better way to organise my to-dos. That belief started a journey of discovery. I looked for and “tested” every productivity app I found being reviewed on YouTube or in one of my favourite blogs. Surely, this time, I would become more productive and have more time for the things I wanted to do. Well, that never happened. The problem was I was trying to control the uncontrollable: Tasks and things to do.

AI is awesome - it can help people build things faster than ever before. On the other hand, it’s also convincing some CTOs that they can build versions of their SaaS tools internally, saving money and avoiding the pesky problems that come with having to deal with anything outside of their fiefdom. This is crazy. Whether this approach is a power grab, hubris, or something else, it’s almost never a good idea. Let’s talk about why. The Bed Is Made Meet CTO Bob. Bob is an AI believer. Fuck.

Background Go was designed for programming at scale.

No obstante, parece que un porcentaje en aumento de empleados y empleadas empieza a mostrar cierto hartazgo de trabajar entre cuatro paredes después de una larga temporada de “comodidad laboral” desde casa, justificada (a veces en exceso) por la tan aludida pandemia. 2. 4. 5.

Vidhya Arvind , Rajasekhar Ummadisetty , Joey Lynch , Vinay Chella Introduction At Netflix our ability to deliver seamless, high-quality, streaming experiences to millions of users hinges on robust, global backend infrastructure. Central to this infrastructure is our use of multiple online distributed databases such as Apache Cassandra , a NoSQL database known for its high availability and scalability. Data Model At its core, the KV abstraction is built around a two-level map architecture.g.g.g.

Setup Link to heading Most cloud providers allow you to set commands to run when a host comes online. The general format for this is called cloud-init or user-data . There’s full documentation for cloud-init here . In my particular case, I had extra files I wanted to write to the host using pulumi . To make it all fit, I was gzip compressing the files then base64 encoding the result.

Recently I&#39;ve had to compile Go to WebAssembly to run in the browser in a couple of small projects ( #1 , #2 ), and in general spent some time looking at WebAssembly . I find WebAssembly to be an exciting technology, both for the web and for other uses (e.g. with WASI); specifically, it&#39;s pretty great that we can take existing projects and components written in Go and run them in the browser. In this post, I will summarize some useful patterns in running Go in the browser via WebAssembly.go1.

Chapter 5 of the Designing Data Intensive Applications (DDIA) book discusses strategies and challenges in replicating data across distributed systems. I had covered the first part last week , here is the second part of leaderless replication. Leaderless replication abandons the concept of a leader node, and allows any replica to directly accept writes from clients. However, it regained popularity after Amazon implemented it in their in-house Dynamo system (not to be confused with DynamoDB).

CH341B and CH341A based “MiniProgrammer” boards are by far the most common low cost flash programmers. They’re able to read and write from most SPI and I2C flash chips, often while the chip is still connected to its circuit. Unfortunately, the designers made some interesting choices: the board supplies 3.3 volts, while using 5 volt logic levels. When used on 3.3 volt systems, can burn out the chip, or worse, backfeed onto the rails and damage other parts on board.3 volts to the socket.3 V).3 V).

Most speakers emit sound in all directions because they are relatively small compared to the wavelength. Audible sounds have wavelengths of up to several meters, so an acoustically “large” speaker might not even fit in your house. Fortunately, strong modulated ultrasound is slowly converted to normal sound as it passes through the air. Ultrasound wavelengths are typically around a centimeter allowing a compact directional speaker. On the other hand, it’s not really a good speaker.

But what happens when we add the dimension of time? Videos are moving images, after all. Text-to-video generation is a complex task that requires AI to understand not just what things look like, but how they move and interact over time. It is an order of magnitude more complex than text-to-image. Comprehend the input prompt 2. 1. 2. 3.e.
