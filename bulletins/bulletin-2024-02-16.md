A lousy engineer is annoying but probably largely inert.

## [DNS OARC 42](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-02/oarc42.html)


The DNS Operations, Analysis, and Research Center (DNS-OARC) brings together DNS service operators, DNS software implementors, and researchers together to share concerns, information and learn together about the operation and evolution of the DNS. They meet between two to three times a year in a workshops format. The most recent workshop was held in Charlotte, North Carolina in early February 2024. Here are my thoughts on the material that was presented and discussed at this workshop.

This story shows how we strive to fix issues reported by our customers regarding inconsistent listing views on our e-commerce platform. We will use a top-down manner to guide you through our story. At the beginning, we highlight the challenges faced by our customers, followed by presenting basic information on how views are personalized on our web application. We then delve deeper into our internal architecture, aiming to clarify how it supports High Availability (HA) by using two data centers.

New York Times Opinion columnist David Brooks shares how to communicate so that others feel seen, heard, and understood. All too often, we communicate without really connecting. The key to building deep connections with others, says David Brooks, is to make them feel seen and heard. Brooks is a writer for the New York Times , the Atlantic , and the best-selling author of several books. “[People] need to be seen, heard, and understood,” he says.S.  (00:16:25) Paradigmatic vs.

Retirement is usually associated with slowing down a little and enjoying your free time. This doesn’t mean you don’t want or need to stay productive. After all, you’ll have day-to-day tasks to take care of as well as personal projects. This week’s article is written by the wonderful Katie Brenneman . Thank you, Katie, for writing this for me. This doesn’t mean you need to put yourself under the same productivity pressure as you may have experienced at work. But they can also exercise your brain.

Over the last year, as a person with a hardware background, I have heard a lot of complaints about Nvidia’s dominance of the machine learning market and whether I can build chips to make the situation better. While the amount of money I would expect it to take is less than $7 trillion, hardware accelerating this wave of AI will be a very tough problem–much tougher than the last wave focused on CNNs–and there is a good reason that Nvidia has become the leader in this field with few competitors.

Posted by Nishant Jain, Pre-doctoral Researcher, and Pradeep Shenoy, Research Scientist, Google Research The constantly changing nature of the world around us poses a significant challenge for the development of AI models. Often, models are trained on longitudinal data with the hope that the training data used will accurately represent inputs the model may receive in the future. More generally, the default assumption that all training data are equally relevant often breaks in practice.e.e.g.g.

Danish 8th, 9th, and 10th graders vote in a mock election every year in Denmark. The results for 2024 were a startling refutation of the idea that young people must be inherently left-leaning. The dominating winner was Liberal Alliance, a center-right party that speaks to the virtues of individualism, entrepreneurship, tax cuts, and a limited welfare state. They took just about every third vote. Some of that is being ascribed to the star power of the party’s young leader, Alex Vanopslagh .

It has to be discharged regularly or it will spoil. And if you let enough of it go to waste, eventually your talents will sour and shrivel with it. This was counterintuitive to me. But it didn’t work like that. Spending eight hours a day spinning my intellectual wheels would get me nowhere at night when I finally tried to move.

## [Verifying Transactional Consistency of MongoDB](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/02/verifying-transactional-consistency-of.html)


This paper presents pseudocodes for the transaction protocols for the three possible MongoDB deployments: WiredTiger, ReplicaSet, and ShardedCluster, and shows that these satisfy different variants of snapshot isolation: namely StrongSI, RealtimeSI, and SessionSI, respectively. Background MongoDB transactions have evolved in three stages (Figure 1): In version 3.2, MongoDB used the WiredTiger storage engine as the default storage engine. In version 4.concur.tid to 0.

## [Tunable Consistency in MongoDB](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/02/tunable-consistency-in-mongodb.html)


This paper appeared in VLDB 2019. It discusses the tunable consistency models in MongoDB and how MongoDB&#39;s speculative execution model and data rollback protocol enable this spectrum of consistency levels efficiently. Motivation Applications often tolerate short or infrequent periods of inconsistency, so it may not make sense for them to pay the high cost of ensuring strong consistency at all times. These types of trade-offs have been partially codified in the PACELC theorem .0.0.6.e.e.0.

Until earlier this week, the support website for networking equipment vendor Juniper Networks was exposing potentially sensitive information tied to customer products, including the exact devices each customer bought, as well as each device&#39;s warranty status, service contracts and serial numbers. Juniper said it has since fixed the problem, and that the inadvertent data exposure stemmed from a recent upgrade to its support portal.

But I wanted a clock that would keep excellent time without relying on the outside world—certainly something better than the time provided by the quartz crystal oscillator used in your typical digital clock or microcontroller, which can drift by about 1.S. dollars .15 seconds in a year.

But it’s also true that a birth occurred in February 1924, with the renaming of the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. as the International Business Machines Corp. And a hundred years after that event, it serves as an important reminder that the world of computing and IT that IBM played a pivotal role in building has a longer history than we are likely to think.S.S.Y.S.C.

E-bikes are today a growing component of the global transition away from fossil fuels—possibly more than the car-and-truck-focused sustainability crowd appreciates. E-bikes’ rapid growth in recent years stems in part from their simple solution to the range issue that big, hulking cars typically don’t offer. E-bikes are powered by relatively small batteries that can be wrangled by the average person who can handle a carton of milk. The Japanese conglomerate Yamaha Motor Co .8 billion by 2027.

This is a guest post. The views expressed here are solely those of the author and do not represent positions of IEEE Spectrum or the IEEE. If Disney’s history of storytelling has taught us anything, it’s to never underestimate the power of a great sidekick. Even though sidekicks aren’t the stars of the show, they provide life and energy and move the story along in important ways. It’s hard to imagine Aladdin without the Genie, or Peter Pan without Tinker Bell. And of course, some new perks.
