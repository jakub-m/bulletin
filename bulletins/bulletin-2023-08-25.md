In large metropolitan areas, tourists are often easy to spot because they&#39;re far more inclined than locals to gaze upward at the surrounding skyscrapers. Security experts say this same tourist dynamic is a dead giveaway in virtually all computer intrusions that lead to devastating attacks like ransomware, and that more organizations should set simple virtual tripwires that sound the alarm when authorized users and devices are spotted exhibiting this behavior.

For him, the cornerstone of good communication is empathizing with an audience enough to truly speak their language. “Think about the audience first,” he says.

## [Everything you never wanted to know about Win32 environment blocks](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/08/23/)


In an effort to avoid programming by superstition , I did a deep dive into the Win32 “environment block,” the data structure holding a process’s environment variables, in order to better understand it. Along the way I discovered implied and undocumented behaviors. (The environment block must not to be confused with the Process Environment Block (PEB) which is different.) Because I cannot possibly retain all the quirky details in my head for long, I’m writing them down for future reference.....e.

## [The Source of Readability](https://programmingdigest.net/digests/1699)


#536 – August 21, 2023 The Source of Readability Readability is often treated as a subjective thing. When someone says code is more readable, what they really mean is they can more easily read it. The straw-man goes, this is all taste and convention, just follow the team’s rules and use the auto-formatter. It covers simple graphs, multigraphs as well as their directed analogues, and more restrictive classes such as tournaments, trees and arborescences. Optimizing speed on eBay.

After six years as a Team Leader, I went back to hands-on engineering work, and I’m very happy about taking this step. While it may appear surprising at first, it was a well-thought-out decision, and actually I’ve already performed such a maneuver once before.

Though most strings online today follow the Unicode standard (e.g., using UTF-8), the Latin 1 standard is still in widespread inside some systems (such as browsers) as JavaScript strings are often stored as either Latin 1, UTF-8 or UTF-16 internally.

eBPF is a relatively new extension of the Linux kernel that can run sandboxed programs in a privileged context. It is used to safely and efficiently extend the capabilities of the kernel at runtime without requiring changes to kernel source code or the loading of kernel modules. Because of eBPFs tight integration with the networking stack at the kernel level, it is seeing adoption in networking applications.

It defines one acronym, TraChe, in the title, but uses another one, Detox, for the rest of the paper.

Onboarding a new or transferred employee when they join a team can be time consuming, but it’s a good problem to have. Offboarding, on the other hand, not so much. Offboarding is not only inconvenient, but doing it poorly can put organizations at risk — as former employees may inadvertently retain access to shared company resources and services after their departure date. If the name of your group changes as a result of a reorganization, the ACL will no longer apply.

In 1984, the late sociologist Charles Perrow published the book: Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies. In this book, he proposed a theory that accidents were unavoidable in systems that had certain properties, and nuclear power plants had these properties. In such systems, accidents would inevitably occur during the normal course of operations. You don’t … Continue reading Normal incidents →

Opinion One of the greatest barriers to widespread LLM adoption may be inherently unsolvable. Photo by Google DeepMind on  Unsplash While Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured the attention of nearly everyone, wide-scale deployment of such technology is slightly limited due to a rather annoying aspect of it — these models tend to hallucinate. In simple terms, they sometimes just make things up, and worst of all, it often looks highly convincing. In simple terms, they make predictions.
