Table-driven tests are a well-known and recommended technique for structuring unit tests in Go. I assume the reader is familiar with table-driven tests; if not, check out this basic example or google for the many tutorials available online.go file, or the input can be non-text.Source on.

Introduction This is the first post in a series that will explore the semantics and implementation details of the Ardan blockchain project. The code is a reference implementation of a blockchain and not intended to mirror any specific blockchain in use today. Even though the code has been engineered with production level coding standards, I wouldn’t use this project for anything more than learning. I am using the Ethereum project as a reference and have taken inspiration from that code.

It’s my 30th birthday, and Megan and I are walking down Duval Street in Key West. There is a pet store here, which must be the most unlikely place for a pet store in all the world. Everyone here is a tourist. What kind of idiot buys a dog while on vacation? You are in the window surrounded by other puppies. A tottering orange ball of fuzz with little triangular ears, like a fox who lost its tail. Ink-black eyes and round button nose. My wife, pregnant and hormonal, is instantly in love with you.

I’m working on a zine about DNS right now, so I’ve been thinking about DNS terminology a lot more than a normal person. Here’s something slightly confusing I’ve noticed about DNS terminology! Two of the most common DNS server terms (“nameserver” and “DNS resolver”) have different meanings depending on the situation. Now this isn’t a problem if you already understand how DNS works – I can easily figure out what type of “nameserver” is being discussed based on context.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1 and 9.9.9.8.8.

Will circuit breakers solve my problems? Maybe, but you need to know what problem you&#39;re trying to solve first. A couple of weeks ago, I started a tiny storm on Twitter by posting this image, and claiming that retries (mostly) make things worse in real-world distributed systems. The bottom line is that retries are often triggered by overload conditions, permanent or transient, and tend to make those conditions worse by increasing traffic. They&#39;re pretty great from a &#34;staying alive&#34; perspective.

Tempo is a leaderless Paxos variant implementing a state machine replication (SMR) protocol. Leaderless means, there is no dedicated/stable Paxos leader, instead any node can become a proposer any time (allowing many concurrent proposers) and get consensus on a proposal opportunistically. In this blog, we had discussed many examples of leaderless and multileader Paxos variants, including Mencius , MDCC , ePaxos , wPaxos , SDPaxos , Hermes , Atlas . You know where I stand on this.e.

Stop writing great runbooks. Instead, fix your production issues. When production has an issue, someone gets paged. A common approach to handling pages in production looks like: Make sure every page has a clear runbook Make sure everyone is trained up on how to run that runbook Runbooks are a set of manual tasks. On-call literature often has things like “no alert should exist without a runbook.” The runbook is exalted. Furthermore, runbooks are often praised for being clear and easy to use.g.

At one point in the story, the FBI agent who is tracking Frank wanted more insight into the forgery technique. They held the counterfeit money in their hands and gave their opinions.)

## [Brain FLOPS](https://geohot.github.io//blog/jekyll/update/2022/02/17/brain-flops.html)


Google “energy for neuron firing” and you get: In final, the energy supply to a neuron by ATP during one action potential is 2.468 × 10^−7 J This means that assuming the brain is drawing 20W, that’s 81M firing events per second. Assuming each neuron has a fan-out of 1000, aka 1000 MACs, that’s 2000 FLOPS per neuron. That’s only 162 GFLOPS…to be fair, they are sparse. But a far cry from 20 PFLOPS, the classic estimate of brain compute. Even assuming they use 1% 1’s, that’s still only 16 TFLOPS.

Welcome back. I’m an experienced developer, learning Golang by building an activity tracker. Last time I added SQLite persistence. Today, I’m going to be porting everything to gRPC. If you’re curious about gRPC – how it works, when to use it, what example code might look like – well, you are in luck because I’m going to be building a grpc client, a grpc server, and the protobuf files for my activity tracker. The full code is on GitHub . However, it has some downsides.0 aka Swagger 2.protobuf.19.

Among the many benefits of GitLab are how it facilitates CI/CD practices, that is continuous integration and continuous deployment . In CI, frequent software updates are immediately tested as they are added to the codebase. In CD, those changes are automatically uploaded to a repository and then deployed to production. Creating and managing CI/CD pipelines can be difficult, however. Each release should have a title, tag name, and description so you can track it.gitlab-ci.yml file.ssh/id_rsa.

A network intrusion at the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) in January led to the theft of personal information on more than 500,000 people receiving assistance from the group. KrebsOnSecurity has learned that the email address used by a cybercriminal actor who offered to sell the stolen ICRC data also was used to register multiple domain names the FBI says are tied to a sprawling media influence operation originating from Iran.

Authentication, authorization, and accounting, often called AAA or Triple-A, are sets of services and protocols that enable granular access control over computer networks. Before the popularity of mainstream HTTP-based authentication protocols such as OAuth and SAML, AAA protocols were the primary way to authenticate users or machines to network services. If you are new to access control concepts, our blog on authentication vs. authorization is the recommended place to start. Supports TLS.

Kubernetes is an API-centric orchestration platform. Every request, from the cluster components to users interacting with the system, has to go through the API server . The API server is a component in the control plane , and acts as a gatekeeper for the operation requests originating from both inside and outside of the cluster. Clients can range from software developers and DevOps engineers using the kubectl CLI to cluster nodes. This is known as authentication , or AuthN .1. X.authorization.

Making technology systems declarative is a key priority for today’s system architects and platform builders. They leverage Kubernetes to achieve this goal of declarative systems but find that Kubernetes alone isn’t enough. It takes a set of modern practices that start from early in the software supply chain and go all the way to production Kubernetes clusters. In this post we provide an overview of how GitOps allows Kubernetes to easily manage declarative ops..

A closer look into PostgreSQL, Redis, and DynamoDB. When designing a notification service, you should ask the question: How do you store subscription metadata? Bear in mind that a well-designed system must provide the opportunity to: find the topics that a user subscribes to, find the users subscribing to a particular topic, and add and remove subscriptions. To meet these criteria, you need to have the ability to query for data stored in the topic_id and user_id categories.csv file hosted in S3.

## [A twisted maze of dependencies](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2022/02/16/deps/)


Oh sure, everyone laughs about things having a lot of dependencies, but do they ever really think about the implications of having hundreds of teeny little libraries, all moving independently? This is how it manifests in the real world. I put Debian on my Mac mini last year after it finally reached the point of no longer receiving even security fixes from Apple. It&#39;s over 10 years old, so I&#39;m more than fine with that. I&#39;m very happy with the situation... Done Building dependency tree....... huh.

Again, it comes down to &#34;HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request&#34; being parsed as part of some binary protocol. I found this while searching the web for &#34;1213486160&#34; to see how things have been going in the past few years.
