## [Tagged nodes no longer need key renewal, which means it&#39;s easier than ever to manage servers](https://tailscale.com/blog/tagged-key-expiry/)


Devices you add to your Tailscale network will periodically expire their node keys and force users to reauthenticate, to ensure the devices are still meant to be on your network. In Tailscale, ACL tags provide a way to assign an identity to a device, which replaces the prior user authentication on that device. So, node key expiry might be surprising behavior for tagged devices, such as servers, which do not have a user associated with them. Generate an auth key for authenticating your server.

It’s very easy to route infrastructure requests, because they all go to that one team. Later on, things are easy as well. You’ll pull up the organization’s service cookbook and get pointed directly to the right team for your specific problem.g.

Hello! A couple of days I wrote about tiny personal programs , and I mentioned that it can be fun to use “secret” undocumented APIs where you need to copy your cookies out of the browser to get access to them. A couple of people asked how to do this, so I wanted to explain how because it’s pretty straightforward. We’ll also talk a tiny bit about what can go wrong, ethical issues, and how this applies to your undocumented APIs. As an example, let’s use Google Hangouts.google. Here’s what happens.

## [How to Set-up an Identity-Aware Access Proxy as a Bastion Host in AWS](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-setup-aws-bastion/)


More and more business-critical applications run on Amazon Web Services. Protecting these mission-critical applications from potential attacks requires moving beyond typical security approaches such as using only a jump box or firewall to control access. This multi-part tutorial will show how DevOps teams can secure their AWS services using a zero-trust, identity-based approach that not only increases security, but improves developer productivity. Let’s dive in.0.0.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.

## [How to Hack Kubernetes (and How to Protect It)](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-hack-kubernetes/)


Kubernetes is a valuable resource and a leading container management system in development pipelines across the world, but it’s not exempt from malicious attacks. Using Kubernetes requires a deep understanding of Kubernetes’ environment—including the different vulnerabilities you can be exposed to while creating, deploying, or running applications in your clusters. Since your Kubernetes cluster is likely one of your most valuable cloud resources, it needs to be protected. 1. ABAC vs. 2.k8s. 4.

## [Kubernetes has crossed the chasm. Will GitOps follow?](https://www.weave.works/blog/kubernetes-crossed-chasm-will-gitops-follow)


The CNCF’s annual survey for 2021 has just been published. Among the headlines is the newfound ubiquity of Kubernetes in the enterprise. With more and more organizations using it – alongside multiple public clouds and in many cases, hybrid cloud too – the need for secure, reliable automation has never been more pressing. And that could well be where GitOps comes in. But 2021 was different. ( You can find the CNCF data here . 5. Explosive growth can quickly lead to needless complexity.

According to Red Hat’s State of Kubernetes Security report, misconfigurations were the leading cause behind security incidents in Kubernetes-orchestrated or otherwise containerized environments. Without proper configuration in place, applications would run into problems ranging from noncompliance and inconsistencies to performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities and functionality failure. This would make cloud-native systems unstable and cause them to become a liability to business.

A repository in Go traditionally contains a single Go Module, which lends naturally to a polyrepo setup – but what if you try to build multiple Golang projects in a single monorepo? It sounds simple enough, but there are actually a few tricks required to get a multi-module monorepo working smoothly. In this article, I demonstrate how to successfully build a monorepo in Go, where each module independently (and efficiently!) manages its own build, test, and release cycles.g.mod │ └── main.New() e.

They own several services that do some data loading and transforming. And the services are under increased load because a new customer (Customer-A) is generating many times the amount of data that most customers do. They manage to get that under control, but a second problem occurs.

And yet we know from experience that attackers are already trying to work out how to turn these patches into a roadmap for exploiting the flaws they fix.

## [A parasitic RPC service that broke core dumps](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2022/03/08/core/)


I already told a story about how you can hose your machine by pointing the Linux kernel at a custom core dump handler and then have that handler fail to function. This&#39;ll clog up the pipe (really), and then everything else will just stack up behind it. Pretty soon, every crashing process will be stuck just the same. What I left out of that story is how it got to that point one time. Yes, this service lived in *client* programs. There are so many problems with this...

## [A sysadmin&#39;s rant about feed readers and crawlers](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2022/03/07/get/)


If a web site makes an RSS or Atom feed available, it&#39;s not a bad idea to poll it from time to time. Actually doing that poll like a good netizen (remember that concept?) takes a little attention to detail. First of all, the feed probably doesn&#39;t change that often. Depending on who it is and what you&#39;re following, you might get an update once a day, or multiple times a day if it&#39;s something really special. Everyone and everything else is going to be somewhere less than that. *exhale* ...........

Here&#39;s a concept: &#34;ssh to prod and edit directly on the machine&#34; is generally bad news. I heard from a third party that someone was doing this at $COMPANY on one of my services, and I just thought (and said to them in chat) something like &#34;ugh&#34; or &#34;oy&#34;. I left it at that. I did not reach out to the actual person who was doing it because I didn&#39;t care that much. This particular company had many, many problems and this one was comparatively minor. But, I didn&#39;t know either way. &#34;But..... I hope...

Quite a while back, I wrote a post that basically went like this: if someone has a problem with someone else or something that person is doing, they&#39;re going to find a way to get to &#34;no&#34;. They will find some reason, some excuse, or some problem with it. They&#39;ll bring up a point and you&#39;ll show that this is not in fact a thing. They will then pivot again and again. But, as I said, that was back then, and this time I&#39;m talking about something else: when it happens in person with a coworker. or ...
