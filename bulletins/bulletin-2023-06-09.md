I normally don’t do either hot-off-the-press writing or “tech news” opinions, but the Vision Pro announcement touches something near to my heart and I want to talk about it. No plan here, just writing and seeing where it goes. I’ve mentioned before that I don’t have a CS degree: in college I did math and physics. When I was 11, I read in _The Physics of Star Trek) that Caltech scientists successfully did teleportation in a lab. There’s no wilderness in software. Wild magic was in the air again.

I ended up getting a response from high level people at AMD. It was still very light on any real technical information, but it did include some great phrases like “I am able to replicate the issues you are facing” and some mockable phrases like “We are hoping that this will improve your perception of AMD products and this will be reflected in your public messaging.” Though they did end up sending me a ROCm 5. But it’s a start. Pro is packaged as part of ROCm in dkms debs . 6.0.5.50500-1581431 6.

What is Progressive Delivery In the traditional waterfall model, new features are released to an entire user base in a big bang release. Progressive delivery is about gradually rolling out the features to select users. Developers and DevOps teams can incrementally roll out and deliver new features with fine-grained controls to a small group of users to minimize the risks of pushing new features to the production environment. 1.

The honeymoon for remote work is over , and managers who never liked the concept to begin with are plotting its complete reversal, so that things may return to how they were before The Great Remote Experiment. This experiment convinced millions of employees of how much better life could be without a commute or even having to live by the office, but also left uneasy the legions of managers whose skills and mindsets were anchored in the office. I say, do or do not. Hybrid is a cop-out.

When I went to school in the 80s and 90s, the communication between the institution and home was limited. Kids could bring home a flyer about some future event, they&#39;d get their grades and remarks detailed in a little grey book, and once a year parents would come in for a chat with the teachers. That was basically it, and it was glorious. In Denmark today, we have a centralized app used by all Danish public schools called Aula. Think of it as Facebook for teachers and parents. All of it sucks.

We’ve already seen Chrome extensions containing obfuscated malicious code . We’ve also seen PCVARK’s malicious ad blockers . When looking for more PCVARK extensions, I stumbled upon an inconspicuous extension called “Translator - Select to Translate.” The only unusual thing about it were its reviews, lots of raving positive reviews mixed with usability complains. Supposedly, it was buggy locale processing. That extension wasn’t alone. It is really named like that. stringify ({ url : tab . sync .

So it wasn’t a surprise that the very first ad blocker I chose semi-randomly (Adblock Web with 700,000 users) turned out malicious. Starting from it, I found another malicious extension (Ad-Blocker, 700,000 users) and two more that have been removed from Chrome Web Store a year ago (BitSafe Adblocker and Adblocker Unlimited).txt .

The new extension, now in beta, brings the magic of your tailnet even closer to your code and makes it easier than ever to share your local development over the internet for collaboration, testing, and experimentation. You can install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace , or learn more about it in our documentation .

Tailscale has never supported password-based authentication. As security-conscious software that connects your private devices across the internet, we had to face a harsh reality: the password is outdated technology that requires kludges to use safely. Passwords must be complex enough that a human cannot remember them and they must not be reused across services, which means we now need software to manage our passwords. Then, share the unique invite URL with that user.

Tailscale makes it easy to create robust networks of devices without having admins worry about properly scoping firewall rules, fine tuning DNS and network configurations, and setting up certificate authorities. To join the network (tailnet), users simply install Tailscale onto their device and log in using an identity provider like Github, Okta, or another one of our supported identity providers.  The fun doesn’t have to stop when Steve drops his ax—bring the magic of Tailscale to work.

Starting today, you can invite anyone to your Tailscale network (tailnet) even if they’re on a different domain or using a shared domain like Gmail. For those using Tailscale at home, you’ll be able to add family and friends with their existing email accounts — so multiple Gmail.com users can be on the same tailnet! For organizations using Tailscale, you can now invite external contractors or partners without setting up a temporary email account or adding them to your IdP.com and Outlook.com.

Network policies allow administrators to define rules based on the source and destination pods, IP addresses, ports, and protocols. These rules can be used to allow or block traffic between different pods or services based on their labels, namespaces, or other attributes.k8s.k8s.k8s.k8s.
