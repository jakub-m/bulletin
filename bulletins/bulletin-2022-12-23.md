DALL-E picture generated from the answer. I was curious, given all the ChatGPT love, what it would make of some of our favorite topics. I was both impressed and unimpressed. Impressed. ChatGPT instantly generated an response that might make a good answer in a Miss Universe contest. You know, the kind of answer delivered with a radiant smile calculated to offend no one yet still sounds comprehensive and deep. Unimpressed. The answers are a mile wide and an inch deep. There&#39;s not a lot of insight.

This article was discussed on Hacker News . The Quite OK Image (QOI) format was announced late last year and finalized into a specification a month later. Initially dismissive, a revisit has shifted my opinion to impressed. The format hits a sweet spot in the trade-off space between complexity, speed, and compression ratio. Also considering its alpha channel support, QOI has become my default choice for embedded image assets. It’s not perfect, but at the very least it’s a solid foundation.g.....

Since version 4.0, transactions have been introduced to the world of Mongo databases. However, the way they work differs greatly from the tried and true world of SQL. In databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL there are transactions based on tables and relations with isolation levels such as READ_UNCOMMITED , READ_COMMITED , REPEATABLE_READ and SERIALIZABLE . In the world of documents, shards and replicas, the changes made to a single document are already atomic by design.2, for distributed data.g.

Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). EC2 is a web service that provides resizable, on-demand computing capacity — literally, servers in Amazon’s data centers — that you use to build and host your software. It’s important to understand that EC2 is a virtual computing environment. In a virtual environment, there is one physical server with all of the necessary hardware — CPU, memory, hard disk, network controller and more.

By: Chanwit Kaewkasi, Weaveworks Senior Software Engineer It&#39;s hard to believe, but this month marks the one-year anniversary of the Weave GitOps Terraform Controller . In just one short year, this tool has revolutionized how we manage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and has brought the true principles of GitOps to the world of Terraform. For those who are new to GitOps, it&#39;s a practice that uses Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application code.

## [A brief rant on converging compliance regimes.](https://lethain.com/compliance-regime-convergance/)


Although I’ve never worked exclusively on compliance, much of my work over the past decade has touched on reconciling between product and compliance goals, and over that time I’ve developed something of a pet theory on the evolution of compliance over the next five to ten years: I expect customer-oriented compliance to converge on a unified set of controls. It’s certainly possible that antitrust regulators will step in to reduce the 1st party advertising advantage here, but by no means certain.

When setting up cloud infrastructure for your team, it often makes sense to provision sensitive services in private subnets. However, this usually means that those services are not easily accessible from your personal devices or CI/CD infrastructure. Tailscale already makes it possible to access those services by adding a private subnet router to your tailnet. Pulumi is an open source infrastructure as code platform for creating, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure.0.0.t3.0.0.0.0.t3.20.

How much does a software bug cost a company? Well that’s a messy question. It depends on the type of bug, the broken behavior, the type of company, etc. And it also depends on how we define “cost”. Catastrophic cases like Knight Capital and Ariane notwithstanding, most of the price of the bug is indirect : lost consumer confidence, opportunity cost of debugging, schedule impacts, etc. These are more nebulous costs and people can disagree on how much they actually are.

Let&#39;s try a thought experiment: we&#39;re going to design a little program that provides a service on a vaguely Unix-flavored box. It&#39;s designed to periodically source information over the Internet from hosts that may be close or far away, and then it keeps a local copy for itself and others to use. You might have it use some kind of config file where it is told the hostnames of the servers it&#39;s going to access. Maybe you&#39;ve set up a pool, such that any given attempt at resolving foo.service.foo.

## [Czemu Paczkomaty wyszły?](https://www.kubafilipowski.com/blog/2022/12/15/cmbok2i6rtrue012gv1jwrx0i9yqkp)


Święta, więc odwiedzam co jakiś czas paczkomat. Paczkomat jest innowacją, której sens ciężko poczuć dopóki się z niej nie skorzysta. Moja paczkomatowa ewolucja wyglądała tak, że na początku wydawało mi się, że to bezsensowny pomysł. Po co mi paczkomat skoro kurier może mi przynieść paczkę do domu lub biura? Okazało się, że była to pochopna opinia. Proces był prosty i szybki, doświadczenie pozytywne. Kluczowym aspektem było to, że mam blisko do paczkomatu i mogę przy nim zaparkować.

## [Elon-exit](https://www.kubafilipowski.com/blog/2022/12/19/elon-exit)


Nie pisałem o Twitterze od jakiegoś czasu bo temat mnie trochę zmęczył, chciałem też dać więcej czasu Elonowi, żeby mógł zaprezentować nam lepiej wizję na rozwój mojej ulubionej aplikacji. Wizja rzeczywiście się pojawiła . Nie było w niej informacji na temat nowego podejścia do wolności słowa,ale była zapowiedź nowych funkcji: lepszych reklam (?), szyfrowanych prywatnych wiadomości, długich tweetów i kolejnej, lepszej wersji weryfikacji. Nowe wątki na ten temat pojawiają się co jakiś czas.

## [Więcej niż jeden App Store na iPhone](https://www.kubafilipowski.com/blog/2022/12/16/w3g1qnejxv7ouoh989lakxv8084jey)


UE chce zmusić Apple do tego, żeby na iPhonie był więcej niż jeden App Store . App Store to jedna z największych innowacji, które przyniósł iPhone. Pierwszy iPhonie nie miał App Store. Nie było aplikacji, które tworzyli niezależni developerzy. iPhone był w pełni kontrolowany przez Apple. Pomysłem Steve’a Jobsa na aplikacje miały być strony webowe, które do dziś można dodawać jako osobną ikonę na iPhonie. Nikt tego oczywiście nie robi. iPhone miał być inny, w pełni kontrolowany i czysty.

Introduction I made it my mission in 2022 to learn everything I could about blockchain and as the year ends, I feel like I accomplished my goal. Love it, hate it, or don’t want to know nothing about it, I think it’s important to push your opinions aside and understand how this technology works. Even with the current collapse of several large crypto companies in 2022, blockchain isn’t going to disappear.

## [Ultimate Go: Advanced Engineering Episode 9](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2022/12/ultimate-go-advanced-engineering-episode-9.html)


Introduction In episode 8, Bill wanted to build a blockchain in Go and began to lay the groundwork for the project. Go is a good choice because its standard library has the necessary network and cryptographical functionality required to build a blockchain. Unlike the previous segment, Bill plans to use this blockchain to manage accounts and balances with hypothetical assets. Bill will reuse concepts from ethereum, bitcoin and the previous segment of the series to implement this blockchain.

Introduction In episode 6, Bill gives an overview of what consensus algorithms are and how these algorithms ensure distributed databases are in sync. Moving forward Bill will adopt the proof of authority (PoA) algorithm as a means to determine which node has the ability to write the next record. To jog your memory, PoA is a consensus mechanism where identity is used as a stake.

## [Ultimate Go: Advanced Engineering Episode 8](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2022/12/ultimate-go-advanced-engineering-episode-8.html)


Introduction In the first part of the series, Bill designed a dependency management system. The dependency manager needed to be distributed, transparent, cryptographically auditable and scalable. To meet these requirements, Bill borrowed concepts from blockchain. He did this to illustrate how the blockchain can be repurposed and used to accomplish the mundane task of dependency management. While doing so, Bill indirectly highlighted the problems a blockchain solves.
