With the rise of new generative AI development methods like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), it can be difficult to demonstrate technical setup to developers and highlight the potential front-end products that can be created by these developer tools. To speed up developer onboarding, Qdrant has developed several Replit templates. Qdrant exposes both HTTP and gRPC APIs so that you can integrate it with any programming language.

As of this writing, I know of three ways to make use of the incremental backup feature that I committed near the end of last month. I&#39;ll be interested to see how people deploy in practice. The first idea is to replace some of the full backups you&#39;re currently doing with incremental backups, saving backup time and network transfer. The third idea is to give up on taking full backups altogether and only ever take incremental backups. Read more »

Interestingly, many instructions defined on 256 bits registers through AVX/AVX2 are not available … Continue reading Implementing the missing sign instruction in AVX-512

Almost one year ago today, we wrote about tech’s downturn . One theme was consistent: we’re in the middle of a reaction, and if you react too far, you’ll be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. What is tech reacting to? Broadly, the last 5&#43; years: Low interest rates, employee-advantaged hiring conditions, DEI programs, polarizing politics, remote work, new iterations of HR-led processes.” This is wrong. Performance reviews matter a lot. There’s no 1:1s. Could be once a quarter.g.

At Aspen Insights, we use Tailscale as our corporate VPN to connect to on-premise resources, 3rd party devices, and our cloud resources. It simplifies and secures a lot of traffic that would have taken considerable time with corporate certificates and CA management in a traditional way. Aspen Insights uses Tailscale subnet routers to connect to our Kubernetes cluster.monitoring.svc.cluster.local. However, there was a unique on-premise Kubernetes cluster we did not own, but worked on.

Hello! I’ve been extremely slowly trying to figure how to explain every core concept in Git (commits! branches! remotes! the staging area!) and commits have been surprisingly tricky. Understanding how git commits are implemented feels pretty straightforward to me (those are facts! I can look it up!), but it’s been much harder to figure out how other people think about commits. So like I’ve been doing a lot recently, I went on Mastodon and started asking some questions.rs b/src/ui/summary..py”.

Hello, fellow Web developers! Icons are an integral part of most modern UIs. What is the best way to embed icons nowadays? This area is full of pitfalls. You better proceed with caution when trying to answer that question. Though there are many possibilities, some of which are considered harmful . Various inline SVG techniques have become more popular over time. Possibly due to the lack of suitable alternatives, although not using the cache is a huge trade-off.

## [Writing a minimal in-memory storage engine for MySQL/MariaDB](http://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-01-09-minimal-in-memory-storage-engine-for-mysql.html)


I spent a week looking at MySQL/MariaDB internals along with ~80 other devs. Although MySQL and MariaDB are mostly the same (more on that later), I focused on MariaDB specifically this week. Before last week I had never built MySQL/MariaDB before. The first day of this hack week, I got MariaDB building locally and made a code tweak so that SELECT 23 returned 213 , and another tweak so that SELECT 80 &#43; 20 returned 60 . 218 lines of C&#43;&#43;. All code for this post can be found in my fork on GitHub ...

## [Reacting to Noise](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1015-Reacting-to-Noise.html)


As someone with insomnia, I typically sleep 3-6 hours a night. About once every 2 weeks, I might sleep 7-8 hours, but that&#39;s really unusual. My college roommates couldn&#39;t understand how I could function on so little sleep. It isn&#39;t a medical issue. (I don&#39;t wake up needing the bathroom and I don&#39;t wake up tired.) I wake up fully rested. Insomnia is just one of those things that runs in my family; one of my parental units often sleeps only a few hours a night. It doesn&#39;t matter when I go to bed.

Posted by Gladys Tyen, Intern, Google Research LLMs are increasingly popular for reasoning tasks, such as multi-turn QA , task completion , code generation , or mathematics . Yet much like people, they do not always solve problems correctly on the first try, especially on tasks for which they were not trained. Therefore, for such systems to be most useful, they should be able to 1) identify where their reasoning went wrong and 2) backtrack to find another solution.98 (using Krippendorff’s α ).

## [BGP in 2023 – BGP Updates](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-01/bgpupd2023.html)


the scalability of BGP as the Internet’s routing protocol is not just dependant on the number of prefixes carried in the routing table. BGP protocol behaviour in the form of dynamic routing updates are also part of this story. If the update rate of BGP is growing faster than we can deploy processing capability to match, then the routing system will lose coherence, and at that point the network will head into periods of instability.

At the start of each year, I’ve been reporting on the behaviour of the Internet’s inter-domain routing system over the previous 12 months, looking in some detail at some metrics from the routing system that can show the essential shape and behaviour of the underlying interconnection fabric of the Internet. Not only is the Internet’s growth slowing down significantly, but in the IPv4 network it appears to be shrinking, which is unprecedented in the brief history of the Internet to date.

It had been 3 years since I had to setup a new laptop. Past Murat had left me helpful instructions , but I got a bad surprise while configuring my Emacs setup. My beloved starter-kits, which worked smoothly under Emacs 27, stopped working under Emacs 29. I tried to fix the errors, but this proved futile due to my limited elisp/emacs skills.  I explored alternative starter-kits to configure Emacs. Doom emerged as the dominant choice, but it appeared large, bloated, and complex for my liking.

How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking (Jordan Ellenberg, 2014) This book discusses applying mathematical thinking in everyday situations for decision-making in order to avoid common pitfalls. The book shows how mathematical principles can be applied to real-world scenarios involving statistics, probability, and game theory. The book loses focus as it disperses its attention. It is funny.

The absurd egress fees charged by major hyperscalers have been one of the biggest impediments for companies to leave the cloud. We’ve been preparing for our own departure from AWS S3 at 37signals , and the price for taking our data elsewhere is in the crazy-land region of $300,000-$400,000! So imagine my surprise seeing the announcement that Google is doing away with the extortionate egress fee entirely for GCP . This applies to all customers globally. That’s good. Very good.

And I didn’t give the gambit better than 30% odds of succeeding, but lo and behold, it did! Apple has approved our app, and it’s now available in the App Store ! What a relief! We’ve spent a whole year getting the HEY Calendar ready. Millions of dollars in investment. And, as sad as it sounds, it all hinges on Apple.

Apple waited until end of business on Friday to send us the formal rejection of the HEY Calendar app. It seems they love to play these little games to try to drown any controversy with the cover of a weekend. But we don’t roll over that easy, so the team worked through the weekend to prepare a new build to appease the App Store’s bullying bureaucrats, and I think you’re going to like what we came up with. They even cite Email Services(!!) as an example in 3.1.3(f): 3.1. Even Google Calendar.

It was a big year for ops at 37signals . In 2023, we moved seven major applications out of the cloud . Including HEY , our email service, which had been born there, and has an extremely high level of uptime criticality.

There should at least be a standard of double jeopardy when it comes to the app store monopoly regimes. If you’ve managed to overturn a rejection of your service once, they can’t come after you on the same service again later. We could have used that today! But unfortunately there is no rule of law with the app stores, except that of the jungle, and Apple is the 800 lbs gorilla, ruling as it sees fit. So now HEY is back on trial in their kangaroo court. This is a ridiculous charge.1.

## [The LEO Satellite Industry Needs More Engineers](https://spectrum.ieee.org/leo-satellite-needs-more-engineers)


Look up. The odds are good that one or more low-Earth-orbit satellites are above you right now.

It’s relatively inexpensive to launch the small spacecraft, and more are being built. Other companies are entering the market, not only to provide broadband access but also to build the smaller rockets.tv .
