## [Why are you so slow?](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2023/10/28/why-are-you-so-slow/)


Recently a shoe store in France ran a promotion called “Rob It to Get It”, which invited customers to try to steal something by grabbing it and running out of the store. But there was a catch — the “security guard” was a professional sprinter, Méba Mickael Zeze. As you would expect, he is fast, but you might not appreciate how much faster he is than an average runner, or even a good runner. Why? That’s the topic of Chapter... Read More Read More

## [Wrangling monotonic systems in TLA⁺](https://ahelwer.ca/post/2023-11-01-tla-finite-monotonic/)


TLA⁺ sees a lot of use modeling distributed systems. The ability to explore all possible interleavings of events makes concurrency simple to reason about. For this TLA⁺ uses something called finite model-checking, which is really just a breadth-first search through the entire state space. The key here - and this really must be emphasized - is that the model is finite. There can’t be an infinite number of states, or of course the model checker will run forever.

The idea for this article arose during a meeting where we learned that our supervisor would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities. In response, a colleague lamented that what we would miss most is the knowledge departing with the leader. Unfortunately, that’s how it goes. Not only do we lose a colleague, but we also lose valuable knowledge and experience. When they leave, they take with them knowledge that you won’t find in any book, note, or Jira ticket.

This is where distributed messaging systems come into play. These systems can handle large volumes of data while allowing systems to communicate and interoperate seamlessly. Kafka architecture.

With Postgres 12 , released in 2019, it became possible to swap out Postgres&#39;s storage engine . This is a feature MySQL has supported for a long time. There are at least 8 different built-in engines you can pick from. MyRocks , MySQL on RocksDB, is another popular third-party distribution. I assume there will be a renaissance of Postgres storage engines. To date, the efforts are nascent. OrioleDB and Citus Columnar are two promising third-party table access methods being actively developed.g.0.

Introduced in 1973, Ethernet is the predominant way of wiring computers together. Chips were soon introduced to handle the low-level aspects of Ethernet: converting data packets into bits, implementing checksums, and handling network collisions. In 1982, Intel announced the i82586 Ethernet LAN coprocessor chip, which went much further by offloading most of the data movement from the main processor to an on-chip coprocessor. The die photo below shows the i82586 chip. One bit of the counter. E.g.

What if you had that job? What if you were with that person? What if there’s a better option out there? If you find yourself asking these questions, Patrick McGinnis invented the term for what you’re experiencing: FOMO. First coined by McGinnis in a piece published by the Harvard Business School newspaper, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) describes the anxiety we feel when thinking that other people are having more fun and living more fulfilling lives than we are. I am missing out on something.

Hello! I’m slowly working on explaining git. One of my biggest problems is that after almost 15 years of using git, I’ve become very used to git’s idiosyncracies and it’s easy for me to forget what’s confusing about it. Here’s a list of the terms: HEAD and “heads” “detached HEAD state” “ours” and “theirs” while merging or rebasing “Your branch is up to date with ‘origin/main’” HEAD^, HEAD~ HEAD^^, HEAD~~, HEAD^2, HEAD~2 .. Here’s a quick summary: “heads” are “branches”.git/refs/heads .git/HEAD .

Tailscale is a programmable network that lets you manage connections between your resources in a declarative way using ACLs , so you can define specifically which users should be able to connect to which services in your environment. Although Tailscale isn’t a service mesh per se, you can use it to connect Kubernetes services to each other. Today, we’re releasing the Tailscale Kubernetes operator to beta .type to LoadBalancer . Set spec.loadBalancerClass to tailscale .com/tailnet-ip: 100.68.29.

At Tailscale, we are constantly making performance improvements, adding new features, and fixing bugs in the Tailscale client. To make it easier for you to get those improvements, we’re adding auto-update support on all platforms where Tailscale runs. For example, when we release a security fix, nodes that enable auto-updates get patched as soon as possible. Some platforms (like Apple App Store and Google Play Store) already do the heavy-lifting for us.52.52 — auto-updates are off by default.

From Lamborghini to Pagani, Porsche to Ferrari, Aston Martin to Bentley, I have owned and loved them all. A&#43; use of lottery money, would do it again! It&#39;s against all these delightful automotive experiences that I&#39;ve been shocked at how utterly compelling the Tesla Model S Plaid has revealed itself to be.

The one that has already fulfilled all the objectives is Workfeed , and now they&#39;re ready to take on the American market. It&#39;s a proud moment! Workfeed makes employee scheduling software.

The most counterintuitive of the Stoic mental exercises is that of negative visualization. Willfully imagining all manner of terrible things that might befall you, but haven&#39;t yet. Described like this, it sorta sounds like a fancy word of anxiety, but if you look closer, it&#39;s in fact its opposite. Nobody makes it through life entirely on easy mode, and if you haven&#39;t done any manner of mental preparation, even small setbacks can seem calamitous. So you really ought to prepare. Exactly.

Not only has the site stayed up, despite hysteric proclamations that it would crater soon after his personnel changes, but X has been able to increase the pace of experimentation and feature introductions at the same time.

## [Observing the power of APIs (Changelog Interviews #564)](https://changelog.com/podcast/564)


Jean Yang’s research on programming languages at Carnegie Mellon led her to realize that APIs are the layer that makes or breaks quality software systems. Unfortunately, developers are underserved by tools for dealing with, securing &amp; understanding APIs. That realization led her to found Akita Software, which led her to join Postman by way of acquisition. That move, at least in part, also led her to join us on this very podcast. We think you’re going to enjoy this interview, we sure did.

AI and machine learning are finally being applied to networking in meaningful ways. On today&#39;s sponsored show we talk with Selector about its AIOps platform, which ingests networking logs, flows, configurations, SNMP, and other telemetry to detect patterns, spot problems, and provide contextual insights to help network engineers do their jobs better. We speak with Selector about what it is, how it works, and concrete use cases.
