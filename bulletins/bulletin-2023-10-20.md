You might think of the Intel 386 processor (1985) as just an early processor in the x86 line, but the 386 was a critical turning point for modern computing in several ways. 1 First, the 386 moved the x86 architecture to 32 bits, defining the dominant computing architecture for the rest of the 20th century. The 386 also established the overwhelming importance of x86, not just for Intel, but for the entire computer industry.5 µm process to the 1 µm process. The shrink from 1. Comparison of the 1.

I know that time spent with my kids is supposed to be its own reward, and it is. But I also want to believe that what I do in this time matters, as much as possible. Elegantly handling a tantrum feels more worthwhile if I’m helping my son learn to express his feelings, not just making it through another day. I find more contentment at the end of a long afternoon if I think that I did a good job and that this good job will echo through the ages, or at least after bedtime. I certainly did.

## [Does Go Have Subtyping?](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2023/10/19/does-go-have-subtyping/)


I’ve been noodling on a static type system for my current hobby language. To try to keep the language as simple as possible, I’m trying to see if I can live without subtyping. Since most of my programming experience is in object-oriented languages, I’ve been learning more about languages that lack—or at least claim to lack—subyping, to see how they work. The short answer is that no, Go doesn’t have subtyping. But also, yes, it sort of does. Subtyping defines a relation between two types./prog.

In 2005 the UN-sponsored World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) eventually agreed on a compromise approach that deferred any determination on the matter of the governance of the Internet and instead decided to convene a series of meetings on the underlying policy principles relating to Internet Governance. Hence, we saw the inauguration of a series of Internet Governance Forum (IGF) meetings. Eighteen later this is still going on. After so long is there anything left to talk about?

We recently released some improvements to our Packages tool, and now we&#39;re extending that work to bring a new System Dependencies tool to Replit, powered by Nix! Replit hasbet big on Nix, and we&#39;re not slowing down. It&#39;s now easier than ever to leverage Nix&#39;s power with a brand-new user interface for adding, removing, and searching system dependencies. WHAT ARE SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES? System dependencies are native programs or libraries that can be installed globally in your Repl using Nix.

## [io_uring basics: Writing a file to disk](http://notes.eatonphil.com/2023-10-19-write-file-to-disk-with-io_uring.html)


King and I wrote a blog post about building an event-driven cross-platform IO library that used io_uring on Linux. We sketched out how it works at a high level but I hadn&#39;t yet internalized how you actually code with io_uring. So I strapped myself down this week and wrote some benchmarks to build my intuition about io_uring and other IO models. I started with implementations in Go and ported them to Zig to make sure I had done the Go versions decently. I could care less about benchmarketing.....

Posted by Han Zhou, Student Researcher, and Subhrajit Roy, Senior Research Scientist, Google Research Prompting large language models (LLMs) has become an efficient learning paradigm for adapting LLMs to a new task by conditioning on human-designed instructions. The remarkable in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs also leads to efficient few-shot learners that can generalize from few-shot input-label pairs. Though multiple calibration solutions have been provided (e.g.e.g..

Optimism vs Pessimism in Distributed Systems What—Me Worry? Avoiding coordination is the one fundamental thing that allows us to build distributed systems that out-scale the performance of a single machine 1 . When we build systems that avoid coordinating, we end up building components that make assumptions about what other components are doing. This, too, is fundamental. One way to classify these assumptions is into optimistic and pessimistic assumptions. I won’t try advance that debate here.

An exciting proposal is expected to land in Go 1.22 - enhancing the pattern-matching capabilities of the default HTTP serving multiplexer in the net/http package. The existing multiplexer ( http.ServeMux ) offers rudimentary path matching, but not much beyond that. This led to a cottage industry of 3rd party libraries to implement more powerful capabilities. I&#39;ve explored these options in my REST Servers in Go series, in parts 1 and 2 . The new multiplexer in 1. NewServeMux () mux . Since Go 1..

In the most simplistic view, there are only two phases in the history of a startup’s life: Before product-market fit, and after product-market fit (PMF). The transition between the two is intense and fundamentally reshapes the experience of working at a startup. Product-market fit is the point at which everything starts to work for a startup – the point when there is a market that is excited to buy what you’re offering to it (the product). The days before product-market fit are a simple time.

As far as existing solutions go, the only reasonably sophisticated approach appears to be Share₂Fedi . Micro.0 .

Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (SADS) is an unexpected death of an adult over 1 year(s) of age. Most SADS events are followed by autopsies, investigations, and funerals. SADS is sometimes called &#34;the long sleep&#34; because of its permanence and characteristic loss of consciousness. Who is at risk for SADS? Over 55 million people die of SADS each year.

## [NEW! The Definitive Guide to Understanding Flagger](https://www.weave.works/blog/guide-to-flagger)


Progressive delivery is complex if done manually. However, given the power behind Kubernetes, YAML files, and Git repositories that can clearly define configuration at each step of the deployment process, progressive delivery is very powerful when done by purpose-built tools. Flagger is a GitOps-based tool that does just this. It works with Flux CD to enable progressive delivery capabilities never possible earlier. Why use Flagger for progressive delivery? Flagger is Kubernetes native.

## [GitOps &amp;amp; Kubernetes Resources for Absolute Beginners](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-kubernetes-resources-for-absolute-beginners)


In the evolving landscape of software delivery and infrastructure management, GitOps has emerged as a leading methodology, tightly intertwining version control with operational processes. At its core, GitOps leverages Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications, seamlessly integrating with platforms like Kubernetes. This approach not only fosters collaboration and consistency but also enhances automation and auditability.

One of the common objections to our cloud exit has been that we shouldn&#39;t have expected good outcomes from a lift&#39;n&#39;shift operation. That the real value of the cloud is in managed services and new architectures, not just running the same software on rented cloud instances. It&#39;s basically the &#34;you&#39;re holding it wrong&#34; argument for the cloud, and it&#39;s hogwash. First of all, HEY was born in the cloud for us. It never lived a life on our own hardware before launch. Which is a reasonable question.

In our quest for making programming simpler, faster, and prettier, no logical fallacy provides as much of an obstacle as “we tried that, didn’t work”. The fallacy that past failed attempts dictates the scope of what&#39;s possible. That just because someone, somewhere, one time attempted something similar and failed, nobody else should try. That lowering our collective ambition to whatever was unachievable by others is somehow good. Here&#39;s a report from Google&#39;s web performance tool Lighthouse.

The concurrency keyword was introduced to GitHub Actions in early 2021. While there are other ways to control and restrict the number of jobs running (per workflow) at any given time, the concurrency keyword is a cleaner solution that can be applied at both the job and workflow levels. Paired with techniques such as workflow triggers, job matrixes, and caching, GitHub Actions gives you all you need to develop a comprehensive concurrency strategy.0.0.

Earthly makes CI/CD builds faster by reusing computation from previous runs for parts of the build that have not changed. This can be a game changer in terms of developer productivity gained. Think about your typical CI/CD pipeline. This is a relatively simple example. When you think about real-world complex CI/CD pipelines, with many project interdependencies, or when you look at the CI builds of monorepos, it gets much more inefficient. Earthly addresses this problem and more.g.e.
