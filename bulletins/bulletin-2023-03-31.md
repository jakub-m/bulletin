## [Pseudocode Showdown](https://ahelwer.ca/post/2023-03-30-pseudocode/)


Last weekend I had a conversation with an undergraduate student new to computer science, who was reading CLRS. “I wish” they said, “that all the pseudocode in my algorithms textbook was just written in Python.” “Ah” I said, “but textbook authors sometimes want their work to endure beyond a decade.” “But Python’s been around for a long time” came the reply, “and it’s very readable, and you can’t execute pseudocode anyway so what’s the harm?

Optimizing compilers seek try to push as much of the computation as possible at compile time. In modern C&#43;&#43;, you can declare a function as ‘constexpr’, meaning that you state explicitly that the function may be executed at compile time. The constexpr qualifier is not magical. There may not be any practical difference in practice between … Continue reading C&#43;&#43;20: consteval and constexpr functions

## [Enabling a Self-Service Developer Experience with GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/enabling-a-self-service-developer-experience-with-gitops)


DevOps disrupted the software development process by tearing down the siloed approach and bringing together developers and ops teams with a singular purpose: building quality applications fast. Organizations quickly shifted and released software faster than the traditional method until they hit a snag. While DevOps normalized developers&#39; and operators&#39; collaboration, it wasn’t smooth. Scaling applications and releasing new features was turning out to be a challenge.

I’ve been playing around with KeePass databases. One aspect was rather surprising: given how many open source products use this format, it is remarkably underdocumented. At best, you can find outdated and incomplete descriptions by random people . The KeePass developers themselves never bothered providing complete documentation. All you get is a semi-intelligible list of changes from KDBX 3.1 to KDBX 4 and from KDBX 4 to KDBX 4.1 . I’ll try to explain the format and the subtle details here.g.g.

This unlocks major use cases such as calling Patterns directly from a client app. Now you can build a chat interface in React and leverage Patterns as your agent-based GPT backend.

## [Making Sense of Kubernetes Metrics](https://sookocheff.com/post/kubernetes/making-sense-of-kubernetes-metrics/)


Shortly after deploying a new Kubernetes cluster, one of the first things you will likely want to do is collect some metrics and data about how it operates. There are two projects that are typically used for this, and since they are named similarly it can be confusing to know which one you should use and why. This post hopes to clear up any confusion between the Kubernetes Metrics Server and kube-state-metrics.

Debugging Frontend part 1 — console Console API is one of the most commonly used tools for debugging, offering much more than just simple log methods. Please bear in mind that you shouldn’t use Console API in most cases in production code. It may be helpful if you need to debug production code, but such methods shouldn’t live in production code for a long time. I will add a usefulness* score to each option I’m describing. It represents the flow of debugging I’m used to.debug console.log console.

The method would construct the request URL and return an error based on the response code received from the server. Miki then created a type that would mock Go’s http.RoundTripper interface and replace his client’s transport with said type to test it.

While many companies build out an elaborate Engineering onboarding program , the process for onboarding new executives tends to be an ad-hoc, chaotic affair. There usually is an executive onboarding process, but it’s used too infrequently to ever get excellent. Part of the problem is similar to that of an executive job search : every executive and role is unique, and it’s hard to create a repeatable program to handle one-of-a-kind onboardings. Onboarding executive peers is different. Tableau.

I agree in principle that if you need a precise count, using the min max difference of an autoincrement column is not reliable. However, using this min max differences may provide a good and fast estimate of the actual row count if your need does not require an exact count but some ball park figures.

We&#39;re excited to announce that Jassim Latif will be joining the Replit executive team as our Vice President of Operations. What does that mean? Who is he? Take a minute to get to know Jassim in his own words. IN YOUR OWN WORDS, WHO ARE YOU? (IDENTITY, LOCATION, INTERESTS, ETC.) I lived in three countries before I turned five, but my family’s last stop was Los Angeles. I was the kid who loved skating to Sharper Image and Fry’s to play around with gadgets. Hence, Replit.io is a great one.

At Replit, we strive to give our users the most powerful programming environment, and what better way is there than giving them an AI pair programmer directly in their workspace? Enter Ghostwriter Chat. WHY WE BUILT GHOSTWRITER CHAT Many IDEs today are not truly integrated; they lack the tools a developer interacts with throughout the course of their work. With Ghostwriter Chat, our goal is to give developers all the power they need without them ever having to leave the IDE.

## [Tailscale Funnel now available in beta](https://tailscale.com/blog/tailscale-funnel-beta/)


Tailscale Funnel, a tool that lets you share a web server on your private tailnet with the public internet, is now available as a beta feature for all users. With Funnel enabled, you can share access to a local development server, test a webhook, or even host a blog. Funnel provides a DNS name tied to your node that becomes publicly accessible once enabled. When a user on the public internet requests your service, we use a secure Tailscale tunnel to forward those requests along.pango-lin.ts.0.0.

We want to make it as easy as possible for teams to get started with Tailscale. So when a new teammate signs up with an @example.com email address, they’ll automatically join the same tailnet as everyone else @example.com. This automatic joining makes it easy to deploy Tailscale — so by default, all that users need to do to join their teammates is sign in with their company email address. When you send an invite from the admin console, the invited user will be emailed a link to tailscale.

At Tailscale, we don’t want your users (or us) managing a separate list of usernames and passwords, which is why you must use single sign-on with an identity provider to create and manage your network. Until now, that meant you needed to choose from a handful of trusted identity providers including Google, Okta, GitHub, and Azure AD. Custom OIDC , now in beta (and available for everyone), changes all that. New users can set up custom OIDC and sign in at login.tailscale.dev lying around.dev/. s .

Then someone else chimed in. “I thought it was a Linux distro, but like, different?” I pulled out my phone and looked it up, “Says here it’s a programming language for managing and building software?” You may have come across some similar confusion when trying to understand what exactly Nix is.1, 14.

The Problem That Mutual TLS Solves Mutual TLS (Transport Layer Security) concept lies under the umbrella of Zero Trust Policy where strict identity verification is required for any client, person, or device trying to access resources in a private network. Mutual TLS solves the problem of authenticating both the client and the server in a communication session. In traditional TLS, only the server is authenticated to the client, leaving the client vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.localdev.

Today on the Tech Bytes podcast, sponsored by Palo Alto Networks, we get into Secure Access Services Edge (SASE), which combines SD-WAN with cloud-delivered security services. You can integrate parts from different vendors, but Palo Alto Networks is here to make a case for why you might want to consider a single-vendor approach.

This page is part of the Hello Deep Learning series of blog posts. You are very welcome to improve this page via GitHub! In this chapter we’re going to build our first neural network and take it for a spin. Weirdly, this demonstration will likely simultaneously make you wonder “is this all??” and also impress you by what even this trivial stuff can do. The first part of this chapter covers the theory, and shows no code.

## [Hello Deep Learning: Intro](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/hello-deep-learning-intro/)


This page is part of the Hello Deep Learning series of blog posts. Also, feel free to skip this intro and head straight for chapter 1 where the machine learning begins! Deep learning and ‘generative AI’ have now truly arrived. If this is a good thing very much remains to be seen. What is certain however is that these technologies will have a huge impact. Up to late 2022, I had unwisely derided the advances of deep learning as overhyped nonsense from people doing fake demos.

## [Hello Deep Learning](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/hello-deep-learning/)


A from scratch GPU-free introduction to modern machine learning. Many tutorials exist already of course, but this one aims to really explain what is going on, from the ground up. Also, we’ll develop the demo until it is actually useful on real life data which you can supply yourself. Other documents start out from the (very impressive) PyTorch environment, or they attempt to math it up from first principles.
