It&#39;s kind of like if writing a unit test on a piece of paper told you where the bug in your code was.

Lately, there has been a proliferation of new ways to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to do all sorts of things that were previously thought infeasible. Despite these shortcomings, progress has not stopped: there have been advances in building systems around LLMs to augment their capabilities so that their weaknesses are no longer limitations. We are now in an age where AI agents can interact with multiple underlying LLMs optimized for different aspects of a complex workflow.

For example, I&#39;ve mentioned needing to monitor the temperature in the server racks.

Solution #1: Internal Many of my servers include internal temperature sensors. In addition: The accuracy of these internal sensors seems to vary wildly.g.

TAG’s blog post covers the targeting and the actor behind the campaign. Notably, all of the previous stages of the exploit chain used n-day vulnerabilities: CVE-2022-4262, a vulnerability patched in Chrome that was unpatched in the Samsung browser (i.e. a &#34;Chrome n-day&#34;), was used to achieve RCE.10.....................

For example, every database with a query language is also a programming language implementation of some caliber. That doesn&#39;t include all databases though of course; see: RocksDB, FoundationDB, TigerBeetle, etc. This post looks at how various databases execute expressions in their query language. tldr; Most surveyed databases use a tree-walking interpreter.g.g.

The leaked data suggests that at least some of website&#39;s code was written by a 36-year-old programmer residing in the capital city of Moldova.

Writing For Somebody Who&#39;s there? Sometimes I write long emails to people at work. Sometimes those emails are generally interesting, and not work-specific at all. Sometimes I share those emails here on my blog. This may be one of those times. Always write for somebody. Always have an idea in your head, as you&#39;re writing, who your writing is intended to communicate with. Sometimes, that&#39;s a particular person. Your boss. A mentee, or mentor. Bob from legal. I want somebody to make this decision.

The Go Blog Fixing For Loops in Go 1.22 David Chase and Russ Cox 19 September 2023 Go 1.21 includes a preview of a change to for loop scoping that we plan to ship in Go 1.22, removing one of the most common Go mistakes. The Problem If you’ve written any amount of Go code, you’ve probably made the mistake of keeping a reference to a loop variable past the end of its iteration, at which point it takes on a new value that you didn’t want.” Although concurrency is often involved, it need not be.20.

## [Implementing Enumerations In Go](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2023/09/implementing-enumerations-in-golang.html)


Introduction Prior to coding in Go, I was writing software in C#. In C# enumerations can be declared and the associated type can be used in functions and as fields in a struct. The compiler won’t allow a value of the enumerated type to be passed or set that doesn’t belong to the defined set. This is something that I have missed since coding in Go. Go doesn’t have enumerations and it can be a problem at times when you want type safety for a well-defined set of values.

However, LLMs are challenging to deploy for real-world applications due to their sheer size.

One problem with working in a customer support environment is that you tend to lose track of just how many tasks you&#39;ve completed. After a few hours, most of them get pretty fuzzy, and by the end of the week, only the most notable ones stand out. A month later, it&#39;s even worse than that. This is just how it goes when there&#39;s so much quantity passing by. This is why I tried to take notes about a handful of them as they happened.

Getting our applications out of the cloud provided the main celebration for our exit, but seeing the actual spend tumble is the prize. See, the only way to get pricing in the cloud down from obscene to merely offensive is through reserved instances. This is where you sign up for a year or more in advance on a certain level of spend. Therefore, we didn&#39;t get the instant collapse in our bills after the applications were moved, but now it&#39;s coming. From around $180,000/month to less than $80,000.

## [How/Why to Sweep Async Tasks Under a Postgres Table](https://taylor.town/pg-task)


I like slim and stupid servers, where each endpoint wraps a very dumb DB query. Dumb queries are fast. Fast queries make websites smooth and snappy. Keep those click/render loops sacred. Sweep complexity under a task table: router.post(&#34;/signup&#34;, async ctx =&gt; { const { email, password } = await ctx.request.body().cookies.set(&#34;usr_id&#34;, usr_id); ctx.response.status = 204; }); This example uses CTEs with postgres.js .

## [Why React Re-Renders](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/why-react-re-renders/)


In React, we don&#39;t update the DOM directly, we tell React what we want the DOM to look like, and React tackles the rest. But how exactly does it do this? In this tutorial, we&#39;ll unpack exactly when and why React re-renders, and how we can use this information to optimize the performance of our React apps.

## [Statements Vs. Expressions](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/statements-vs-expressions/)


One of the most foundational things to understand about JavaScript is that programs are made up of statements, and statements have slots for expressions. In this blog post, we&#39;ll dig into how these two structures work, and see how building an intuition about this can help us solve practical problems.

## [Announcing “use-sound”, a React Hook for Sound Effects](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/announcing-use-sound-react-hook/)


By and large, using the web is a visual experience. This is in terrible contrast to mobile apps, which interact with three of our human senses (sight, sound, and touch, through haptic feedback). I just released a library to make it easy to add sound to your React app, and I make the case that you should consider using it!
