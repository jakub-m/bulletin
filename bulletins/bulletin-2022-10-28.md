But the men’s lawyers claimed that the recording was a fake, and that the police had fabricated it by splicing together clips taken at different times. The hum seeps into microphones and recordings, which is a pain for sound engineers, but surprisingly useful for forensic analysts. 1...

  There&#39;s a move to regulate cloud providers by vertically separating the services they offer. Like railroads of yore, who were not allowed to provide freight services on top of their base services, cloud providers would not be allowed to provide services on top of their base platform services. Vertical separation would be new to the cloud industry. Is it a good idea? Would it actually solve any problems? My answers are no and no, but probably not for the reasons you think.

Last week Gabriella Gonzalez wrote What does “isomorphic” mean (in Haskell) , which covers isomorphism from a first-principles perspective. At the very end she says In my experience, the more you train your ability to reason formally about isomorphisms the more you broaden your ability to recognize disparate things as equivalent and draw interesting connections between them. I want to expand a bit more on how they’re useful. Isomorphisms Let’s start with an example. Take the string &#34;abc&#34; . F.  ↩

What’s the secret to coming up with good ideas? For Jeremy Utley, it’s about generating as many as possible.  The director of executive education at the Stanford d.school, Utley says, “very few problems we face in business or in life have a single right answer.” All ideas — the good, the bad, and the ugly — are “a necessary input to an innovation process,” and an essential step in getting to solutions that will actually work.

Today, we’re launching a web-based SSH client: Tailscale SSH Console. From the Tailscale admin console, admins will now see a little “SSH…” button to connect to devices running Tailscale SSH . Click this, and you’ll pop open an SSH client, right in your browser. Tailscale SSH Console is now available in beta. To start a Tailscale SSH Console session, click “SSH” on the device, select the username you want to connect as, and reauthenticate. Web-based SSH clients aren’t new.

If you’re managing and using Tailscale along with several other users, it’s hard to keep track of what changes get made, even with audit logs . For example, another admin might make an update, or an event that you need to react to could occur — such as a node needing authorization . Webhooks are owned by the tailnet, so any webhooks set up by an admin will continue to work even if that admin leaves the company. To set up a webhook, navigate to the webhooks tab of the admin console .

## [No More Manual Reviews — Policy as Code to the Rescue](https://www.weave.works/blog/no-more-manual-reviews)


Automation was the original benefit of DevOps, but GitOps is what enables automation without the downside of poor security, and things breaking in production. As infrastructure, networking and more start getting defined as code, all its inherent artifacts like configuration management, provisioning manifests, runbooks, deployment scripts, and packages become testable as code. Policy as code makes this possible. This is counterproductive. If not, changes are automatically reverted.

Kubernetes is witnessing wide adoption by organizations across industries. Its deployment capabilities with zero downtime, resilient infrastructure, automatic rollbacks, high scalability, and self-healing features are primarily due to its deployment capabilities. But the one benefit that separates it from others is that it simplifies the complexity of managing containers at scale. Kubernetes achieves this through a powerful concept called nodes. A node, in turn, can run multiple Pods.

## [Concurrency in Go](https://earthly.dev/blog/concurrency-in-Go/)


Introduction By default, computer programs are executed sequentially, usually line-by-line. Although this is very efficient, you may need to run multiple processes simultaneously or control the flow and runtime of your programs for numerous reasons. Luckily, Go gives us a way to run various processes concurrently or in parallel. Concurrency comes in handy for speed, process synchronization, and resource utilization.

Container orchestration tools automate container management tasks, such as scheduling, scaling, load balancing, and networking .

They solve many of the challenges of successful container operation by abstracting low-level concepts and providing solutions for common problems. Orchestrators allow you to rapidly deploy containers and scale them across multiple physical hosts.io .k3s.githubusercontent.4.k3s.24.
