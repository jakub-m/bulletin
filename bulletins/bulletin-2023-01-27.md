Lots of admin stuff today! First, we have a new blogpost , the full version of the complexity preview I shared last week. I’m also announcing a new TLA&#43; workshop ! Or more precisely, three workshops. To make it easier on people’s schedules, there are three dates you can sign up for: March 20, May 15, and June 12. And there’s no fee to move between classes if something comes up and you can’t make your session. Use the code C0MPUT3RTHINGS for 15% off. . 1 Anyway, on to the main thing... Joy.  ↩

## [Is Scalable OLTP in the Cloud a Solved Problem? (CIDR 2023)](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2023/01/is-scalable-oltp-in-cloud-solved.html)


This paper appeared in CIDR 2023 recently. It is a thought provoking big picture paper, coming from a great  team. The paper draws attention to the divide between conventional wisdom on building scalable OLTP databases (shared-nothing architecture) and how they are built and deployed on the cloud (shared storage architecture). The paper doesn&#39;t analyze this divide in detail, and jumps off to discuss shared storage with multiple writer as a more scalable way to build cloud OLTP databases.e.

The most common question about retrowin32 , my Windows emulator — after &#34;why even do this?&#34; — is about how it actually works. This is the kind of thing that now feels obvious to me but which was a great mystery before I understood it, so here I hope to present it in a way that will make it obvious to you too. Emulating the Windows API To start with, imagine you&#39;re on an x86 machine that is running some OS other than Windows and you want to run a Windows program somehow. To execute a Windows .g.

Some time ago, our central cloud governance team was piloting a new way of authentication towards AWS via AWS SSO. We thought it would be an excellent opportunity to revise our current flow, draw conclusions and proceed with some improvements. I was asked to provide support in this regard. My goal was clearly defined. I wanted to design and introduce a flow that won’t annoy my teammates. This can be pretty cumbersome. or even work in a multi-account setup. The idea is simple and easy to manage.

## [Reverse proxying a sub-domain via Apache](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/reverse-proxying-a-sub-domain-via-apache/)


Suppose you have a domain that hosts your website: domain.com , and the website is served with the venerable Apache HTTP server . Suppose, also, that you want to run some backend application on the same domain, perhaps using a sub-domain like sub.domain.com . Running an application on a non-standard port (not 80 or 443) is not a problem, but what it you need it to run on port 80? Apache occupies port 80 in order to serve domain.com , so at least on the surface this seems like a problem.domain.0.

Want to change someone’s mind? First, explains Robert Cialdini, you have to change their framing. For  Cialdini , the Regent&#39;s Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Marketing at Arizona State University, persuasion begins before we even deliver our pitch or presentation. Through what he calls “pre-suasion,” communicators can prime audiences to receive messages in a specific way, simply by drawing their attention in specific directions.

For example, we have a service that stores a movie entity’s metadata or a service that stores metadata about images. All of these services at a later point want to annotate their objects or entities. Annotations Sometimes people describe annotations as tags but that is a limited definition. Allows to annotate any entity.

The balances on these addresses are reconstructed by reading the previous transaction records found on his blockchain.

These clients can then be used with any standard OAuth 2.

I lost interest in computer hardware during the 2010s. It seemed years would pass with only meager, marginal improvements. Intel was stuck in a rut, so CPUs were barely improving. The only bright spot for me was Apple&#39;s progress with their A-series chips for phones. But that felt like a segregated reality from that of regular computers. Not just in Apple land, but with AMD and Intel too. The generational jumps are happening more frequently, and the gains aren&#39;t measly any longer.

Back in 2018, when I first wrote about sizing engineering teams , I was surprised how much my advice rankled a colleague. He wanted to spin up a new engineering team of two people, which I thought was a bad idea. It would be a fragile team that would fall apart quickly if it didn’t grow. It would be missing the components we’d seen make other teams successful, like an engaged manager or ability to handle on-call if someone took a vacation. Both are valuable approaches to keep in your pocket.

When I shared my piece on Measuring an engineering organization , one point I made was that focusing too heavily on optimization metrics (e.g. things like CI/CD time) can turn engineering into a cost center. That’s not because optimization metrics aren’t important, they’re extremely important! Rather, it’s inherent to what it means to refer to an organization as a cost center. Other organizations were not invited. However, I think this common usage isn’t very helpful.

## [Day Two Cloud 179: Will CXL Make Composable Infrastructure Real?](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/day-two-cloud-179-will-cxl-make-composable-infrastructure-real/)


On today&#39;s Day Two Cloud podcast we talk about Compute Express Link (CXL), a technology for composable infrastructure. The idea is to take all the peripherals in a system---network cards, memory, graphical processing units, and so on---and put them on a bus outside the chassis to share them among multiple hosts. Is this the dream of composable infrastructure coming true? The post Day Two Cloud 179: Will CXL Make Composable Infrastructure Real? appeared first on Packet Pushers .

Last September, at the 🇨🇭 Swiss Cloud Native Day, Florian Forster, co-founder &amp; CEO of ZITADEL, talked about why they switched to serverless containers. ZITADEL has a really interesting workload that is both CPU intensive and latency sensitive. On top of this, their users are global, and traffic is bursty. Florian talks about how they evaluated AWS, GCP &amp; Azure before they settled on the platform that met their requirements.

An inspiration from software development Introduction Setting up a development environment is usually the first step people do when starting any coding project. An effective development environment can be a huge productivity boost that helps us to produce high-quality work. This process in data science, however, is very ambiguous compared to other fields like software development due to its own uniqueness and challenges. Settling into the team was complete chaos. We can get the best out of both.

They run containers on Google Cloud. Why is that important and why should you care? Containers are at the heart of modern applications. According to the 2022 State of DevOps report, containers have been the number one deployment target for primary services and applications for the past two years, and adoption continues to accelerate rapidly.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the retail industry.  Google pioneered container technologies and Google Cloud is optimized for containers.

When it comes to pricing strategy, balancing profit and conversion has long been a challenge for retailers, and one compounded by today’s rapidly changing commerce landscape.  Macroeconomic factors such as rising costs of goods, fluctuating costs of shipping, changing consumer demand, and inflation make keeping up with pricing decisions nearly impossible.  The solutions were developed with retailers at the forefront of the design. It is also precisely why Google is excited about the partnership.

Managing digital asset transactions and their often-competing requirements to be secure and timely can be daunting. Human errors can lead to millions in assets being instantly lost, especially when managing your own encryption keys. This is where multi-party computation (MPC) can help reduce risk stemming from single points of compromise and facilitate instant, policy-compliant transactions.   Distributed parties can participate in a signing process that is both auditable and policy-compliant.
