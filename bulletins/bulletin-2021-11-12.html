                        A year or so back I wrote the newsletter post Don’t use Markdown for documentation , where I complained about its lack of extensibility and cross-project referencing. People’s critique fell along two lines: “Everybody on the team already knows and is willing to write markdown”: fair enough— I mostly care about dense, complex technical writing by an enthusiastic writer.

                        After years of hopping between coasts, Charles found a home for his family and his ambitions in Silicon Valley. LinkedIn made the transition seamless, setting him up for success from day one, even through the challenges of the pandemic. Moving around has always been a way of life for me. Originally from Montreal, Canada, I moved to the U.S. in 2006, first to Boston, then Atlanta, Hawaii, and back to Atlanta. Once my wife and I had kids, I thought my years of changing cities were behind me.

In this organization, on-call SREs have elevated access to production systems, but when they are off-duty, their privileges are reduced. When the Pager Duty alert goes off, our on-call SRE ssh’s into the server but after several minutes of looking, can’t diagnose the issue.gravitational.tar.3.3.3..

                        Deployment is an integral part of the software development life cycle. It is the process where the application’s codebase is compiled, run through a series of tests (such as unit, integration, and build tests), and then deployed to different environments (such as development, staging, or production). To speed up the process of deployments and ensure deployment reliability during software development, developers introduced the concept of automated deployment or continuous deployment (CD). 1. 4.

Smishing messages usually include a link to a site that spoofs a popular bank and tries to siphon personal information. But increasingly, phishers are turning to a hybrid form of smishing -- blasting out linkless text messages about suspicious bank transfers as a pretext for immediately calling and scamming anyone who responds via text.

                        Microsoft Corp. today released updates to quash at least 55 security bugs in its Windows operating systems and other software. Two of the patches address vulnerabilities that are already being used in active attacks online, and four of the flaws were disclosed publicly before today -- potentially giving adversaries a head start in figuring out how to exploit them.

                        The U.S. Department of Justice said today it arrested a Ukrainian man who deployed ransomware on behalf of the REvil ransomware gang, a Russian cybercriminal collective that has extorted hundreds of millions from victim organizations. The DOJ also said it had seized $6.1 million in cryptocurrency sent to another REvil affiliate, and that the State Department is now offering up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of any key leaders of REvil.

We will start with a quick explanation of what CI/CD is, and a review of the previous two installments of this tutorial series. Then you can start learning about the CircleCI .config.yml file included in this code repo.config.

                        Is it possible to use just one tool to test everything? Although it may sound like a developer’s daydream, it is almost possible with Cypress , a JavaScript frontend testing framework. Cypress is built specifically for JavaScript frontend developers, and they can use it to start writing tests quickly without needing to add third-party dependencies or packages. This is a benefit missing from other tools like Selenium. In this tutorial, I will guide you through using Cypress to test an API.16.to.

Digital signatures use what is known as a keypair, a pair of random looking values, where one key is a “private key” and the other a “public key”. Through digital signatures, any person with the “private key” can “sign” a transaction and spend the digital currencies. Enter threshold cryptography.e.

                        In writing about my dumb little &#34;mailserv&#34; project this past weekend, I purposely avoided mentioning some of the parameters lest they distract from the message I was trying to convey. My attempted message was something along the lines of &#34;everyone starts somewhere, ignorance is the default state until changed, and look at some of the shit I have inflicted upon the world as proof&#34;. I&#39;ve talked about the finer points of that before, and it&#39;s not really on topic here. Check this out.

                        There&#39;s something to be said for writing a post late on a Saturday night. For some reason, it tends to bring out THE ONE more than any other time of the week. I wonder why that is. For those of you with better self-control than me who can manage to not look, there&#39;s a raging comment section on HN going on about yesterday&#39;s post, and most of it is about terrible SQL practices. Basically, not only was I clueless 20 years ago, I definitely still am now. I mean, you&#39;re not wrong...........

                        The first time you encounter something, you&#39;re probably going to make some mistakes. There&#39;s a post going around tonight about how someone forgot to put an index on some database thing and wound up doing full table scans (or something like that). The rub is that instead of just being slow, it also cost a fair amount of money because this crazy vendor system charged by the row or somesuch. Blocking them did little since they forged everything - the HELO, the MAIL FROM, you name it...domain | ....

There&#39;s 2036 for the NTP era rollover, 2038 for time_t requiring 32 bits in January *and* another GPS week rollover in November. It turns out we have another one coming up far sooner, too: 2028! Looking at the current year gives you a hint. It&#39;s 2021, but another way of looking at that is that we&#39;re 121 years past the year 1900... until 2028, that is. Neat! ... .....

                        The previous post was a warmup for this post. It gave an example of the theorem that if p is a polynomial, the roots of p′ lie inside the convex hull of the roots of p. If p is a cubic polynomial, we can say much more. Suppose p(z) is a polynomial with three distinct […] The post Marden’s amazing theorem first appeared on John D. Cook .

                        There’s a well-known theorem in complex analysis that says that if p is a polynomial, then the zeros of its derivative p′ lie inside the convex hull of the zeros of p. The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set containing those points. This post gives a brief illustration of […] The post Convex hull of zeros first appeared on John D. Cook .

                        Each year, about 200,000 U.S. veterans transition out of military service. However, despite being well-equipped to work in the tech sector , many of these veterans are unable to identify a clear career path. In fact, a 2019 survey found that many veterans feel unprepared for the job market after their service and are unaware of how GI benefits can be used for learning and training. That’s where Google Cloud skills training comes in.  Cloud skills are also in demand.S. Read Article

                        When solving a new ML problem, it’s common to start by experimenting with a subset of your data in a notebook environment. But if you want to execute a long-running job, add accelerators, or run multiple training trials with different input parameters, you’ll likely find yourself copying code over to a Python file to do the actual computation. With the executor, your notebook is run cell by cell on Vertex AI Training.  Built to Scale Imagine you’re tasked with building a new image classifier.

One of the best ways to scale your machine learning (ML) workflows is to run them as a pipeline, where each pipeline step is a distinct piece of your ML process. Pipelines are a great tool for productionizing, sharing, and reliably reproducing ML workflows across your organization. They are also the key to MLOps – with Pipelines you can build systems to automatically retrain and deploy models.
