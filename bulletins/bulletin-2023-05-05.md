## [FOSS I Love](https://ahelwer.ca/post/2023-04-29-sunshine-moonlight/)


Here I’ll write an ode to two closely-linked FOSS projects that have, recently, absolutely floored me with their competence &amp; quality: Sunshine and Moonlight. These are used to stream video games over a (usually local) network. Sunshine is a game streaming server: it runs on your PC as it chugs away doing all the heavy lifting of running the game itself, while Moonlight is a game streaming client that runs on whatever thin hardware exists where you want to play the game!

Managers in such periods spend much of their time on hiring and onboarding , with the remainder devoted to organizational structure and high-level strategy . Their technical expertise is important, but it’s demonstrated indirectly in the quality of their strategy, structure, and hiring. In 2023, our universe has shifted.g.

If you want to join in the fun, use the code C0MPUT3RTHINGS for 15% off. I make most of my money off teaching workshops, and that means I put a lot of time into thinking about how to teach them better. Most of that goes to lesson planning, topic order, pedagogical improvements, etc. But I also regularly write assistive programs.  ↩

This paper appeared in NSDI&#39;06 . It explores the behavior of open and closed system models. These two models differ in how they handle new job arrivals. In an open system model, new jobs arrive independently of job completions. In contrast, in a closed system model, new jobs are only triggered by job completions, followed by think time. The paper makes a basic but an important point that was missed by many people that were building workload generators and making system design decisions...g.

## [A way forward for PfP: Pain-free Passwords](https://palant.info/2023/05/02/a-way-forward-for-pfp-pain-free-passwords/)


A month ago I announced the end of PfP: Pain-free Passwords . But I’m allowed to change my mind, right? Yes, PfP will be developed further after all. However, it’s so different that I’m publishing it as a new browser extension, not an update to the existing extension. Rather than using its own data format, PfP 3.x reads and writes KeePass database files. In order for the extension to access these files, users have to install a PfP Native Host application . Also, PfP 3.x development. PfP 3.x.

The Prime Video team at Amazon has published a rather remarkable case study on their decision to dump their serverless, microservices architecture and replace it with a monolith instead. This move saved them a staggering 90%(!!) on operating costs, and simplified the system too. What a win! But beyond celebrating their good sense, I think there&#39;s a bigger point here that applies to our entire industry... In theory, this would allow us to scale each service component independently...&#34; Bingo.

Jordan Peterson calls this the &#34;meaningful burden&#34; in 12 Rules for Life , and downright posits it as an antidote to depression. Echoing Victor Frankl&#39;s famous quote &#34;he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how&#34; from Man&#39;s Search for Meaning . And I&#39;ve seen countless others do it too.

On today&#39;s sponsored Heavy Networking we&#39;re going after the work-from-anywhere challenge with Fortinet’s Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) tech, all of which is baked into FortiOS. If you’re running a FortiGate, you’ve got these capabilities already.
