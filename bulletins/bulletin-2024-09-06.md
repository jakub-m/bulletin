We sometimes have to work a large quantity of floating-point numbers. This volume can be detrimental to performance. Thus we often want to compress these numbers. Large-language models routinely do so. A sensible approach is to convert them to brain floating point numbers. These are 16-bit numbers that are often capable of representing accurately a … Continue reading Compressing floating-point numbers quickly by converting them to brain floats

Suppose you’re working in C using one of the major toolchains — that is, it’s mainly a C&#43;&#43; implementation — and you need regular expressions. You could integrate a library, but there’s a regex implementation in the C&#43;&#43; standard library included with your compiler, just within reach. As a resourceful engineer, using an asset already in hand seems prudent. But it’s a C&#43;&#43; interface, and you’re using C instead of C&#43;&#43; for a reason, perhaps to avoid dealing with C&#43;&#43; . Have no worries.e. data [ i ]....

## [Weekend project: Nonlinear sound propagation](https://10maurycy10.github.io/misc/non_linear_sound/)


Sound normally behaves linearly, a tone at one frequency won’t create or effect one at another. But this isn’t always the case if the sound is loud enough. As a quick experiment, I took an ultrasonic distance sensor, and connected a function generator directly to the sensor’s transducer. I also connected another transducer to my oscilloscope as an ultrasound detector. Interestingly, it sounded like it was coming from the wall the transducer was pointed at. Even my small ~1.

The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a ship tracking system. It&#39;s main aim is to help avoid maritime collisions by making vessels identify where they are. AIS messages include a Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number. This is a temporarily-assigned unique identifier that among other things, will identify the flag a vessel is sailing under. The Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency (FTIA) hosts an open data API for maritime traffic in and around Finnish Waterways.1 GHz .0.38.0.

Lamport released TLA&#43; in 1999 and shepherded its development for the past 25 years. Transferring ownership of TLA&#43; to the official foundation has been in the works for a while now, and now it&#39;s time. In the document, Lamport also talks about some of his hopes for how the foundation will think about evolving TLA&#43;. &#34;Simplicity is a major goal of TLA&#43;&#34;. Complicating the tooling..

There’s a genre of computer games called incremental games , whose entire design philosophy can be summarized as, “numbers go up.” These games focus on the fundamental gaming loop rather than plot, characterization or anything beyond the foundational satisfaction of numbers increasing. I’m thinking about numbers going up, because I’ve been watching the number of Amazon ratings on Staff Engineer creep up over the past few months knowing that it would soon reach 1,000 ratings.

## [Intel Honesty](https://stratechery.com/2024/intel-honesty/)


The best way to both save Intel and have leading edge manufacturing in the U.S. is to split the company, and for the U.S. government to pick up the bill via purchase guarantees.

## [Building a Smart Home - Part 16 Seasonal Automation&#39;s](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2024-09-01-building-a-smart-home---part-16-seasonal-automations/)


In the 2024.4 release of Home Assistant, the Labels feature was introduced. This feature allows you to add labels to entities, areas, and automations. This is a great feature for organisation as you can apply as many as you want and then perform actions based on those labels. Previously, I’d tackled this style of organisation (and the organisation that Categories introduced) by putting keywords into the names of my automations, and while this worked, it wasn’t as clean as I would have liked.

I was working on a game that has randomness. After some play testing, I decided I wanted that randomness to be deterministic—in other words, I needed to seed the random number generator. I wanted players to be able to share seeds so they could play the same games. Unfortunately, I was using JavaScript’s Math.random() to get random values. This isn’t seeded. I needed to replace Math.random() with something else! First, I found a dependency that did this for me... rules: { // ...

Hurrying through the National Gallery of Art five minutes before closing, I passed a Navajo weaving with a complex abstract pattern. Suddenly, I realized the pattern was strangely familiar, so I stopped and looked closely. The design turned out to be an image of Intel&#39;s Pentium chip, the start of the long-lived Pentium family. 1 The weaver, Marilou Schultz, created the artwork in 1994 using traditional materials and techniques. &#34;Replica of a Chip&#34;, created by Marilou Schultz, 1994.

An ETF is an exchange-traded fund, which holds a collection of assets and trades on an exchange like a single stock. For example, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) tracks the S&amp;P 500 index, but unlike traditional index funds, you can buy or sell shares in minutes.

He demonstrates how to enhance AI-driven interactions by integrating real-time data retrieval and multi-turn conversations, pushing beyond static data sources to create more responsive and context-aware systems. Implementing real-time parsing and AI search of live websites.

This second part of Chapter 4 of the Designing Data Intensive Applications (DDIA) book discusses methods of data flow in distributed systems, covering dataflow through databases, service calls, and asynchronous message passing. For databases, the process writing to the database encodes the data, and the reading process decodes it. We need both backward and forward compatibility, as older and newer versions of code may coexist during rolling upgrades. Two main approaches here are REST and SOAP.

This paper recently appeared at ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review. It provides an overview of the shared log abstraction in distributed systems, particularly focusing on its application in State Machine Replication (SMR) and consensus protocols. The paper argues that this abstraction can simplify the design and implementation of distributed systems, and can make them more reliable and easier to maintain. This is a wisdom packed paper. Here is how we will crack this nut.2.D of the paper.e.g.

Incident response is about more than just putting out fires. Yes, there are definitely those all-hands-on-deck moments when an incident arises. But you also need a structure in place ahead of time to provide the right information to the right people when they need it — while still avoiding alert fatigue. Plus, you need a culture that actually encourages people to continually improve what’s in place without just pointing fingers. The transcript below has been edited for length and clarity..com .

It intuitively rings true until you give it a moment&#39;s consideration. Putting it crudely, it&#39;s easier to be fat and ignorant in a world of cheap, empty calories than it is to be fit and informed. It&#39;s hard to resist the temptation of minimal effort. And Linux isn&#39;t minimal effort. Thus, it serves as a dojo for understanding computers better. Or ought to be different.
