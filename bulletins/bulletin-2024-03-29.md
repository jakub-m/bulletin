## [Discussing Open Source funding and sustainability on the Sustain podcast](https://jacobian.org/2024/mar/29/sustain-podcast/)


I was invited on the Sustain podcast to discuss my recent rant about open source sustainability. I talked about my reaction to the criticism that open source maintainers receive when they take funding, and how this is a personal issue for me – maintainers aren’t abstract ideas to me, they’re my friends . We discussed my call for a more expansive definition of open source, and got into some of the nuance about some of the problems this can cause.

No failure notices. No error messages. It was just powered off. When I came into the office, I tried to turn it on, but it never even got to the post-on-self-test (POST) stage. This is a serious hardware failure. The good news is, I was able to open the case and pull the hard drive...1, last updated in 2003...

Why deep connection with others starts by connecting more deeply with ourselves. How are you feeling right now?

Teoh is a facilitator of the course Interpersonal Dynamics , one of Stanford Graduate School of Business’s most iconic classes. In her work with students and as a CEO coach, Teoh encourages people to get better acquainted with their feelings.

You can get a coach, find mentors, take classes, read, listen to podcasts, or pursue any number of other different ways to learn – the right learning strategy is the one that you’ll actually follow through on.

In 1979, Intel introduced the 8088 microprocessor, a variant of the 16-bit 8086 processor. IBM&#39;s decision to use the 8088 processor in the IBM PC (1981) was a critical point in computer history, leading to the dominance of the x86 architecture that continues to the present. I&#39;ve been reverse-engineering the 8088 from die photos and this blog post discusses what I&#39;ve uncovered about the prefetch circuitry. The die photo below shows the 8088 microprocessor under a microscope.e.e.g.g. 16, no.1979.

Travelling for work can have some upsides. You get to see a little more of the world and interact with new people. Yet, it can also be a challenging experience. It’s not unusual to find that the pressure to juggle multiple tasks while contending with travel triggers experiences of stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression. Not to mention that disruptions to your productivity may affect your workplace efficacy. This week’s article is written by the wonderful Katie Brenneman . Team cohesion.

For the last eighteen months I’ve been writing a book about being a dad. Two weeks ago I finished the first draft! The book is inspired by my blog posts about parenting , but most of it is brand new and I think it might be very good. It’s about childbirth, covid, careers, old friends, new friends, kid friends, chess, pianos, screens, AI, marriage, and much more. Now that I’ve finished a draft I’m looking for an agent and a publisher. Thanks!

Humanity only has one engineering project, building better engineers than humans. After that, the thing we built can do the engineering. Clips have been making the rounds on Twitter from my second Lex about the “bishop guy” in a chess engine, or a “cone guy” in a self driving car. These engineering ideas look ever more ridiculous. Since the beginning of comma, I wanted to make a machine that could drive cars like a human. So there shouldn’t be any reference to traffic cones in your codebase.

Posted by Urs Köster, Software Engineer, Google Research Time series problems are ubiquitous, from forecasting weather and traffic patterns to understanding economic trends. Bayesian approaches start with an assumption about the data&#39;s patterns (prior probability), collecting evidence (e.g., new time series data), and continuously updating that assumption to form a posterior probability distribution.g., the commonly used Mauna Loa CO2 dataset. It is implemented in JAX and uses the flax.e.g.

This is how the git glossary defines it. It’s what git status says on the first line It’s what you most recently checked out with git checkout or git switch It’s what’s in your shell’s git prompt . I used git version 2.39. . .0.0.0.0.0.0.

Ben and Ryan are joined by Bill Harding, CEO of GitClear, for a discussion of AI-generated code quality and its impact on productivity. GitClear’s research has highlighted the fact that while AI can suggest valid code, it can’t necessarily reuse and modify existing code—a recipe for long-term challenges in maintainability and test coverage if devs are too dependent on AI code-gen tools.

Only doing product-led work can lead to an unmaintainable system with lots of downtime. Unfortunately, getting time to work on the things that would prevent that can be challenging. Engineering roadmaps balance many competing demands, and the people making the decisions aren’t always the closest to the code. There is a need to learn how to speak their language. By Ben Hartshorne

Cellular architecture is a design pattern that helps achieve high availability in multi-tenant applications. The goal is to design your application so that you can deploy all of its components into an isolated &#34;cell&#34; that is fully self-sufficient. It can benefit your customers regarding availability and ensure you hit your SLAs. By Chris Price

Hey, I just deployed — and this is crazy. But the server’s down, so call me, maybe? Making your services available at all times is the gold standard of modern software operations. The easiest way to reach this would be to just write bug-free software , but even if you reach this completely unattainable goal — stuff happens! Modern software rarely exists in a vacuum and often depends on a multitude of external services and libraries. Eventually, something can — and will — go wrong.g.g.g.g.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT has an extraordinary ability to process natural language, reason about a user’s prompts, and generate human-like conversation in response. However, as the saying goes, “a picture is worth a thousand words” — and perhaps an even more significant achievement is ChatGPT’s ability to understand and answer questions about images. Basically, we’ll have an AI-agent-turned-intelligence-analyst at our fingertips.  Let’s get started. Copy @openai_client = OpenAI::Client.unsplash.unsplash.

Last November, Dimitris and Giordano Ricci wrote a blog post about CI/CD observability that looked into ways to extract traces and metrics in order to get a better understanding of possible issues inside a CI/CD system. That post focused on getting data from a continuous integration (CI) system, and it really resonated with the community. Our focus here was on finding ways to extract DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics from the CD workflows of some of our internal services.g.

Monitoring your identity provider’s logs is critical to identify potential security threats. These logs are vital for a security team, who may store them in a specialized tool like Grafana Loki for enhanced accessibility and analysis. The ability to pinpoint specific patterns within these logs is key — and by crafting these patterns into Loki queries, you can conduct focused searches across logs. Enter Sigma , an open standard for defining pattern detection rules. &lt;img src=&#34;https://grafana.

These days, everything can be tracked: transportation, deliveries, food orders . . . For consumers, knowing the location of a package or courier is a bonus, but for companies in the business of shipping, delivering, and third-party logistics, it’s a necessity. And so is having the right observability system to ensure everything gets where it needs to go. After all, errors, downtime, or anything that causes delays will end up delivering unhappy customers and lost revenue. Sign up for free now!

To gain a better understanding of the brain, why not draw inspiration from it?

The researchers hope that the technology could one day be used in implantable brain-machine interfaces to read brain activity. That receiver then decodes the information. “It opens a lot of possibilities.”

He found the transition from employee to business owner to be a steep learning curve. Taking on a host of unfamiliar responsibilities like finance and sales required a significant shift in mind-set. “We are bringing about change. We are going into an industry and improving it.”

## [5 Ways to Strengthen the AI Acquisition Process](https://spectrum.ieee.org/5-ways-strengthen-ai-acquisition)


In our last article, A How-To Guide on Acquiring AI Systems , we explained why the IEEE P3119 Standard for the Procurement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automated Decision Systems (ADS) is needed. In this article, we give further details about the draft standard and the use of regulatory “sandboxes ” to test the developing standard against real-world AI procurement use cases. The standard can give government agencies a method to ensure transparency from AI vendors about associated risks.K.

As EV production and, with it, battery production accelerate over the next decade, so too will the demand for rigorous EV battery testing. But producing a battery that will stand up to the task of powering an electric vehicle for years under different weather conditions and unpredictable usage patterns is no mean feat. One such product family was the BAT300 series electric power testing devices made by Unico . “Battery companies have expended enormous effort on predictive modeling.S.

## [How to Boot Up a New Engineering Program](https://spectrum.ieee.org/brandeis-university-engineering)


Starting a new engineering program at a university is no simple task. But that’s just what Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., is doing. By 2026, the university will offer an undergraduate engineering degree —but without creating an engineering department. IEEE Spectrum spoke with Seth Fraden, one of the new program’s interim cochairs, about getting a new engineering program up and running. Seth Fraden Seth Fraden is a professor of physics at Brandeis University.”

## [Inkjets Are for More Than Just Printing](https://spectrum.ieee.org/inkjet-printer)


In the early 1980s, offices were noisy places, filled with the sound of metal striking inked ribbons to mark characters on paper. IBM Selectric typewriters clacked, daisy wheel printers clattered, and dot-matrix printers made loud ripping sounds. Today, those noises are gone. And though we do spend more time reading on screens, we haven’t stopped printing on paper. The main reason for the quiet? The inkjet printer. The printhead of an inkjet printer performs a remarkable task.5-by-7.6-cm slide.

## [We Need to Decarbonize Software](https://spectrum.ieee.org/green-software)


Software may be eating the world , but it is also heating it. In December 2023, representatives from nearly 200 countries gathered in Dubai for COP28, the U.N.’s climate-change conference, to discuss the urgent need to lower emissions. Meanwhile, COP28’s website produced 3.69 grams of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) per page load, according to the website sustainability scoring tool Ecograder . This was not inevitable. The green software movement is fast gaining momentum. “It’s not just lines of code.”

## [6G Terahertz Devices Demand 3D Electronics](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rf-filter-6g-terahertz)


Smartphones have a scaling problem. Specifically, the radio-frequency (RF) filters that every phone—and every wireless device in general—uses to extract information from isolated wireless signals are too big, too flat, and too numerous. And without these filters, wireless communications simply wouldn’t work at all. “They are literally the entire backbone of wireless systems,” says Roozbeh Tabrizian , a researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Another involves space.”
