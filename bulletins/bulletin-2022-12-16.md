## [re:Presenting at AWS re:Invent](https://technology.riotgames.com/news/representing-aws-reinvent)


Earlier this month, nearly a hundred Rioters traveled to Las Vegas to attend AWS re:Invent, a weeklong conference hosted by AWS. This year, we also had a number of activations for attendees, letting allowing us to deepen our engagement with the global cloud community and celebrate our games and IP. In this article, we’ll give a quick recap of our presence - the presentations, the booths, the party - and a human grab claw!

## [Abstraction is Expensive](https://programmingdigest.net/digests/1455)


#502 – December 12, 2022 Abstraction is Expensive As you build a computer system, little things start to show up: maybe that database query is awkward for the feature you are building, or you find your server getting bogged down transferring gigabytes of data in hexadecimal ASCII, or your app translates itself to Japanese on the fly for hundreds of thousands of separate users. Use it with popular frameworks like RSpec, Pytest, Jest, Minitest, JUnit, Elixir, and more.

This is the third post in a series about proxy servers and Go. Here is a list of posts in the series: Part 1 - HTTP Proxies Part 2 - HTTPS Proxies Part 3 - SOCKS Proxies (this part) So far the series has covered HTTP and HTTPS proxies; this part is a brief discussion of SOCKS - an old and venerable proxy protocol designed to relay any kind of TCP or UDP traffic through forward proxies. It predates HTTP version 1. A brief comparison of SOCKS5 and CONNECT proxies is included later in the post.0.0.

Universal adoption of agile practices has accelerated the software development lifecycle across the industry. A development project following the waterfall paradigm would put testing right before the production release phase. Here, security teams perform both static and dynamic analysis testing procedures, and their results either give the application a green flag for deployment or reject it pending remediation from developers.

You might know Secret Santa as the gifting game where each person in a group is assigned another person in the group to give a gift to. For three years in a row, I’ve organized a post card exchange for plotter enthusiasts called #ptpx, which I think of as a sort of “generalized Secret Santa”. Instead of just sending and receiving one gift, participants choose how many postcards they’d like to make and send.

I first learned Vim in university and, since then, it has been a welcome companion for the majority of my software engineering career. Working with Python and Go programs felt natural with Vim and I was always felt productive. Yet Java was always a different beast. Whenever an opportunity to work with Java came up, I would inevitably try Vim for a while, but fall back to IntelliJ and the IdeaVim plugin to take advantage of the rich language features a full-featured IDE can give you.

Created by Stable Diffusion The 70s were a time of excess and rebellion, a carefree era where people embraced their wildest impulses and let their hair down. But as the years went by, people realized that the true freedom lies not in the absence of rules, but in the discipline to follow them. And so, they put away their acid-washed jeans and neon-colored hair, and embraced a more structured, disciplined way of life. This led to inconsistencies and confusion.

## [Introducing tailnet lock: use Tailscale without trusting our infrastructure!](https://tailscale.com/blog/tailnet-lock/)


Users sometimes ask us, “How can I trust Tailscale?” From the beginning, we’ve tried to make it so you don’t have to, by architecting our infrastructure with security and privacy in mind. When you use Tailscale, your data is end-to-end encrypted. Tailscale doesn’t have the private key, so we can’t see your traffic. Which brings us to one glaring issue that has remained with our architecture: You have still needed to trust our coordination server. With tailnet lock enabled, we add an extra step.

You can experience these improvements in the current unstable Tailscale client release , and also in Tailscale v1.36, available in early 2023. In this post, we will focus on throughput.

A few weeks ago I had a call with a startup founder who was frustrated with their team. The team kept getting distracted by interesting work, and was avoiding the most important work to move the business forward. The founder’s response surprised me a bit. Beliefs are different then facts, because beliefs are not entirely grounded in evidence. The most obvious example would be choosing to believe (or to not believe) in a greater power.. This was, from my point of view, a major failing.

Introduction In episode 2, Bill designed a database for his dependency manager to enable Go developers to have reproducible,durable and secure builds. This database will house the hash value for each of the dependencies stored. During runtime, these hash values are compared with the dependencies a user has locally. Bill’s tool makes this comparison to make sure the user has the right version of the dependency.

Introduction In episode 3, Bill needed to figure out how to share ownership of his dependency manager’s database in a secure and efficient manner. Bill is the only stakeholder with full access to his dependency manager’s database. That is, he is the only person with the ability to mutate the database. This is problematic because he can freely edit the database which will make it harder for other users to confidently perform audits.

Introduction In episode 1, Bill finished by describing the dependency management conundrum Go faced in its early days. Prior to the Go team providing the module system, developers were on their own to find a solution. Engineers in the Go community did propose different solutions, but there was no general consensus on which tool to use for dependency management. In this video, Bill will begin to architect a solution to the reproducible build problem.

## [Inflacja bazowa w USA już w deflacji](https://www.kubafilipowski.com/blog/2022/12/15/ns4nb4lrc67nrewmi18tgqxs5vtiwl)


Wracam do inflacji, im więcej czytam na ten temat tym bardziej wierzę w swoją predykcję, że przejdziemy z dwucyfrowej inflacji w tym roku do deflacji w drugiej połowie przyszłego roku. To co może zaskoczyć to ceny energii i żywności, ciężko to przewidywać. Jeśli będzie umiarkowana pogoda latem, dobre zbiory, wojna na Ukrainie jakoś się skończy i capy na ropę zaczną działać, to może być naprawdę tanio. Oczywiście, to działa też w drugą stronę. (z 6,6% we wrześniu, do 6,3% w październiku i 6.

## [Krypto i efekt Lindy](https://www.kubafilipowski.com/blog/2022/12/14/krypto-i-efekt-lindy)


Czytając którąś z książek Nassima Taleba natknąłem się na teorię efektu Lindy (Lindy effect). Teoria skupia się na przewidywaniu długości istnienia elementów kultury lub technologii. Efekt Lindy mówi, że każdy fenomen kulturowy i technologiczny będzie istniał proporcjonalnie długo do tego ile czasu już istnieje. Jeśli książka jest druku od 10 lat, to z dużym prawdopodobieństwem będzie w druku przez kolejne 10 lat. Ilekroć myślę o krypto to myślę o Lindy. Krypto jest w kryzysie.

Rok się kończy więc postanowiłem podzielić się listą aplikacji, które odkryłem w tym roku, lub w tym roku zacząłem ich intensywniej używać i mi służą. Arc - przeglądarka. Wydawało się, że temat przeglądarek jest już zamknięty, jednak Arc do siebie przekonało. Ma silnik Chrome, więc wszystko po prostu działa, łącznie z Extensions, Arc ma inny layout, zamiast tabów u góry, ma je po lewej. To jest dość dziwne ale wydaje się, że Arc został zaprojektowany do używania na pełnym ekranie. Użyteczne.

## [Dwa wykresy z internetu](https://www.kubafilipowski.com/blog/2022/12/12/dwa-wykresy-z-internetu)


Znalazłem wykres w internecie. Wykres pokazuje jak zmieniał się czas, który poświęcamy na konsumpcję mediów w ciągu ostatnich 10 lat. Patrzenie w telefon urosło z 45 minut w 2011 do ponad 4 godzin 2021. Komputer stacjonarny z 40 do 50 minut TV i Radio spadło o ~20%, magazyny o 50% ale magazyny i tak były marginalnie małe. Okazuje się, że ludzie patrzą w telefon tyle samo czasu co w TV, a komputer, przy którym ja spędzam większość dnia, jest bardziej niszowym medium niż radio.

Znalazłem opracowanie naukowe, które dobrze łechta mój confirmation bias na temat wysokiej inflacji, której doświadczyliśmy w tym roku. Ekonomiści zrobili symulację szoku cenowego dla wszystkich 71 branż amerykańskiego GUSu . Celem symulacji było wytypowanie sektorów, które systemowo wpływają na wysokość inflacji w USA. Polityka monetarna działa na całą gospodarkę, nie tylko na te sektory. Izrael reguluje ceny podstawowych produktów spożywczych. Państwo może też inwestować w mieszkania.

Developing code for serverless platforms requires a different approach to your development flow. Since the platform provides and maintains the entire stack, from compute infrastructure up to the function handler, your code runs in a fully managed and abstracted environment. This can make it time consuming and inefficient to debug your code by deploying and invoking a Function in the cloud. Fortunately, Cloud Functions offers an alternative that lets you implement and debug your code much faster.

## [Centralized Multi Cluster Ingress with Anthos Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/centralized-multi-cluster-ingress-anthos-service-mesh/)


We have never seen a proliferation of open source products sparked by a tool like we have seen with Kubernetes. These building blocks are what make Kubernetes the de facto container orchestrator to securely and reliably run services. Since organizations don&#39;t run Kubernetes on its own, Kubernetes is more often than not deployed alongside other tools to solve real business challenges that Kuberntes doesn’t natively solve. It&#39;s this concern that drives the design of the cloud foundation.rich_text.

## [How to use Google Cloud Serverless tech to iterate quickly in a startup environment](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/startups/use-serverless-tech-to-iterate-quickly-in-a-startup-environment/)


In a startup, you need to get to the MVP fast, gather feedback from early adopters, and iterate in a quick cycle. Anything that takes time away from developing and iterating on features delays the launch and that’s a serious problem when time-to-market is crucial. Less time on infrastructure means more time implementing and iterating on your services. Additionally, most serverless products have a pay-as-you-go pricing model with little upfront cost at the beginning.
