                                I’m a pretty gullible person. When I was a kid, my sister told me that there was a monster inside the toilet. For years after I’d flush and then run out of the bathroom in panic. As a teen, I discovered the James Randi forums and immediately became a true believer in the power of skepticism. 1 Skepticism is great! It’ll keep me from falling for flimflam anymore. If I follow the principles of skepticism then people will stop thinking I’m gullible. 2 I can’t believe I’m about to defend crypto.

But when I looked up “how to find a domain’s authoritative nameserver” to see what advice was out there, I found a lot of different methods being mentioned, some of which can give you the wrong answer. So let’s walk through a way to find your domain’s authoritative nameservers that’s guaranteed to always give you the correct answer. I’ll also explain why some of the other methods aren’t always accurate.ns.4.

Rather than struggling to find the source image, they just take a screenshot. We call these &#39;app shots&#39; because they typically show the application as well as the content displayed by the application. Some of these even contain the play/pause controls. Thanks.).).e.

Early approaches, which often fell short, eventually gave rise to modern approaches that have been very successful. In this post, I’ll highlight five areas where ML is poised to have such impact.g.g.2T parameter GLaM model).g.g.g.g.S.S. energy mix.g.e.S.2x).g.D.

                                Automating software delivery is a high priority for any organization that follows DevOps or cloud-native practices. However, automation is not easy, and if done wrong, it can leave organizations worse off than when they started. As a DevOps leader, you need to know the right path to take so your software organization can achieve the automation it desires. The annual State of DevOps Report for 2021 stresses the importance of automation for any organization. Read it today.

                                It’s hard to believe that GitOps was considered nascent just a couple of years ago. Looking back, 2021 has been a milestone year for GitOps with explosive customer adoption, various industry validations, and launches of new CNCF initiatives. GitOps is now widely accepted across vendors, ecosystems, and communities. This post is a sort of victory lap for GitOps covering the most important milestones and advances in the space from the past year. It is often considered an extension of DevOps.

Can you rank the slices from largest to smallest?

                                Error handling in Go is a little different than other mainstream programming languages like Java, JavaScript, or Python. Go’s built-in errors don’t contain stack traces, nor do they support conventional try / catch methods to handle them. Instead, errors in Go are just values returned by functions, and they can be treated in much the same way as any other datatype - leading to a surprisingly lightweight and simple design. There are a few other important things to note in the example above.As ...

                                In a great many ransomware attacks, the criminals who pillage the victim&#39;s network are not the same crooks who gained the initial access to the victim organization. More commonly, the infected PC or stolen VPN credentials the gang used to break in were purchased from a cybercriminal middleman known as an initial access broker. This post examines some of the clues left behind by Wazawaka, the handle chosen by a major access broker in the Russian-speaking cybercrime scene.

                                Microsoft today released updates to plug nearly 120 security holes in Windows and supported software. Six of the vulnerabilities were publicly detailed already, potentially giving attackers a head start in figuring out how to exploit them in unpatched systems. More concerning, Microsoft warns that one of the flaws fixed this month is &#34;wormable,&#34; meaning no human interaction would be required for an attack to spread from one vulnerable Windows box to another.

But Norton 360 isn&#39;t alone in this dubious endeavor: Avira antivirus -- which has built a base of 500 million users worldwide largely by making the product free -- was recently bought by the same company that owns Norton 360 and is introducing its customers to a service called Avira Crypto.

Yaron Singer joins us in this episode to discuss model vulnerabilities and automatic prevention of bad outcomes. By separating concerns and creating a “firewall” around your AI models, it’s possible to secure your AI workflows and prevent model failure.

                                SSH servers are a common target for brute-force attacks. This is even more true if your infrastructure sits behind an SSH bastion because attackers have no choice but to compromise the bastion host either by exploitation or denial of service. In this article, we will list a few controls which will help you harden your SSH servers from brute- force attacks. We can do this by reducing the value of the MaxTries variable in the sshd_config file from its default of 6 . TCP wrappers use the hosts.168.

                                SSH bastion hosts are an indispensable security enforcement stack for secure infrastructure access. Every security compliance standard that deals with remote infrastructure access (e.g., FedRAMP AC-17 - Remote Access, HIPAA §164.312(a)(1) - Access control, SOC2 CC6.1 - Manage Points of Access) mandates preventing direct network access to the servers and APIs. After all, bastion hosts are the first target for attackers looking to compromise access to infrastructure.g.04 LTS server image.0.0.254.

These last couple of years have made it seem like we just never know what is coming next. It’s no different for financial services companies who have to be prepared for the unexpected, including disruptive technologies that can challenge their core businesses. I am watching all this play out in real time as an account executive at Teleport. They also care about speed.

Why? Simple. Market valuations are much higher for SaaS companies than they are for traditional software and hardware companies. The median multiple on earnings for a SaaS company is 12.7x as of Q3 2021 according to venture capitalist Jamin Ball who tracks the Public Cloud Software (e.g.1 to 12.2.

                                Optimizing cloud costs means more than looking at your bill and hunting down unused instances. It&#39;s about understanding the full lifecycle of cloud workloads, dealing with management that wants predictable spending even as your actual usage varies, and setting up repeatable processes. Guests Fred Chagnon and Jeremy Roberts, both at Info-Tech Research Group, offer practical advice for optimizing your cloud spending.

Aruba is our sponsor and we’re joined by James Robertson, CTO Advisor and Technology Strategist in the Office of the CTO.

                                Using CircleCI’s orbs is a great way to share CI/CD configuration across projects. Public orbs work well for wide adoption, but private orbs have been helpful for organizations needing to share common internal configuration in a secure, non-public way. Private orbs work only within the organization that publishes them. We recently opened up private orbs access to all CircleCI customers, including those on the Free plan . This new access opens up a number of new possibilities for your pipelines.

Designed for human interaction, YAML is a strict superset of JSON, another data serialization language. But because it’s a strict superset, it can do everything that JSON can and more. One major difference is that newlines and indentation actually mean something in YAML, as opposed to JSON, which uses brackets and braces. The first line of a config.6.4.

                                Freemium plans are a great way for companies to introduce developers to their products and offer a hands-on demonstration of the value they provide. But it can be extremely frustrating for developers when a free tier limits access to key features or doesn’t provide enough capacity to evaluate how the product performs in real-world development scenarios. CircleCI is no exception. That’s why we decided to overhaul our offerings to provide the most comprehensive free plan available on the market.

                                We are often asked if the cloud is more secure than on-premise infrastructure. The quick answer is that, in general, it is. The complete answer is more nuanced and is grounded in a series of cloud security “megatrends” that drive technological innovation and improve the overall security posture of cloud providers and customers. An on-prem environment can, with a lot of effort, have the same default level of security as a reputable cloud provider’s infrastructure. We’re in this together.

                                One of the best practices of software development is to refactor common code into modules and then use it across your application. A key feature of Dialogflow CX is to ensure that multiple teams are able to work on complex agents. This will require that it supports reuse of common functionality across flows , not just in a single agent but even across agents.  In this blog post, we are going to take a look at how to use a Subflow while designing a Dialogflow CX Agent...
