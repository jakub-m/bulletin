                                As I’ve started doing a bit more angel investing, I’ve ended up chatting with a handful of folks working on the engineering boarding space, and here is my collection of thoughts on the space. Engineering onboarding is the process by which a recently hired engineer becomes a proficient contributor to your company. As companies scale, they tend to devote an increasingly large amount of energy into this space.g. Facebook’s bootcamp model ).g.g.g.g.g.g.g.

                                Computers generally track the current time using a quartz crystal that oscillates at a known frequency. This frequency is used to advance the local clock at pre-defined intervals. Quartz oscillates with enough stability that it can be used to maintain time within a few milliseconds of accuracy per day. Over time however, these imperfections can accumulate, making the clock inaccurate.

This move freed us from the limits imposed by third party proprietary (3PP) platforms and saved millions in licensing, support, and other operating expenses.

                                What do modern cloud workloads look like? And what does that have to do with new chip designs?

The speakers at ReInvent are not just introducing new products/services, but they are also explaining the thought processes behind them. To come up with this summary, I edited the YouTube video transcripts slightly (mostly shortening it). Each task is called a thread. ...

                                Project by Netflix’s Cloud Infrastructure Security team ( Alex Bainbridge , Mike Grima , Nick Siow) Cloud security is a hard problem, but an even harder one is cloud security at scale. In recent years we’ve seen several cloud focused data breaches and evidence shows that threat actors are becoming more advanced with their techniques, goals, and tooling . In 2020, we decided to reinvent how we handle cloud security findings by redefining how we write and respond to cloud detections.

No? Ok. Well, at least we agree it&#39;s better than not having the chart you want where you want it, right? I thought so. That&#39;s why we made our main performance monitoring view modular.

                                Over the last week, there have been a couple of really weird news items. These news items made me double-check the calendar to make sure it wasn&#39;t April Fools&#39; Day. Mobile Phone One of my first memories as a child was of a Fisher-Price &#34;chatter telephone&#34;. It was really just a wooden block with some atttached plastic that made it look like a phone with a face. It had a rotary dial and a plastic receiver. And most importantly, it was on wheels. As the wheels spun, the eyes would go up and down.

                                “To be creative, ideas must be both novel and useful. That’s the definition that we use in creativity research,” says Justin Berg , an assistant professor of organizational behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business. But, he warns: “Novel ideas are often not very useful and useful ideas are often not very novel.  “The takeaway is that we should never stop being a creator.”  Think Fast, Talk Smart is a podcast produced by Stanford Graduate School of Business.

                                I&#39;ve told some stories about what happens when you end up at a company that builds nothing and instead rents everything from some vendor. Given that, it&#39;s only fair that I describe something bad that can happen at a company which is known for building stuff. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re at one of these companies which has a reputation for building infrastructure stuff instead of renting it. The trouble is that sometimes these companies will hire someone who&#39;s known for doing X... and *only* X.

                                For many developers, Docker was their first exposure to the wonderful world of containers. Containers have changed the way we develop and ship software, and the pace of change isn’t slowing down. As containerization technology matures and becomes more widely adopted, there is a growing desire to bring open standards to the field, and this is where Podman comes in. Like Docker, Podman is OCI-compliant.” To be compliant means that the two tools are both able to build and run OCI-compliant images.

                                 What Is Containerization? Let’s start with the basics. You can think of containerization as a type of operating system virtualization in which applications run packaged with all the necessary components, configurations, and libraries in a user space abstracted from the host OS, called a “container”. While the portability of containerized apps and cloud-friendly microservices is one of their main benefits, this is far from the only problem they solve.deb and .8% adoption rate.

                                Hello! I talked to a couple of friends recently who mentioned they wished they knew how to use dig to make DNS queries, so here’s a quick blog post about it. When I first started using dig I found it a bit intimidating – there are so many options! I’m going to leave out most of dig’s options in this post and just talk about the ones I actually use. Also I learned recently that you can set up a .digrc configuration file to make its output easier to read and it makes it SO MUCH nicer to use.ca ).

                                A 31-year-old Canadian man has been arrested and charged with fraud in connection with numerous ransomware attacks against businesses, government agencies and private citizens throughout Canada and the United States. Canadian authorities describe him as &#34;the most prolific cybercriminal we&#39;ve identified in Canada,&#34; but so far they&#39;ve released few other details about the investigation or the defendant.

                                Rarely do cybercriminal gangs that deploy ransomware gain the initial access to the target themselves. More commonly, that access is purchased from a cybercriminal broker who specializes in stealing remote access credentials -- such as usernames and passwords needed to remotely connect to the target&#39;s network. In this post we&#39;ll look at the clues left behind by &#34;Babam,&#34; the handle chosen by a cybercriminal who has sold such access to ransomware groups on many occasions over the past few years.

                                In today’s IT environments, operating systems blend into each other. In on-premises and hybrid or public cloud scenarios, Windows clients connect to Linux-based web servers and Kubernetes containers or microservices. There are several Windows-friendly SSH clients available to keep these connections secure. We’ll examine cost, ease of setup and use, and feature set from a protocol supportability perspective for each client. Solar-PuTTY is available as a free tool.

                                In our last blog post How to Pass a FedRAMP Audit for SaaS Providers: Part 1 , we looked at what FedRAMP is and why it matters for SaaS providers. We also discussed a success story with one publicly traded Teleport SaaS customer who used Teleport to pass their FedRAMP audit. In this blog post, we will look at the specific controls you need to implement in order to pass your FedRAMP audit. FedRAMP categorizes levels of impact as Low, Moderate, and High. • Ports that were forwarded.

It&#39;s becoming an essential read for anyone interested in how companies are using DevOps. The findings show that GitOps principles are integral to top performing teams. Here are the highlights from the report.  According to the report, SRE and DevOps are not competing practices. SRE and DevOps are both about how to automate and achieve operational excellence. The trunk never gets frozen.

                                There are a lot of good things you can do with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automation, repeatability, and ease of operations and development. But there are also code and infrastructure pitfalls where you can tumble into a hole, break your leg, and get eaten by spiders. OK, maybe not  that bad, but on today&#39;s episode we talk about potential IaC pitfalls and how to avoid them with guest Tim Davis.

                                Gatsby is a static website and application generator that makes building powerful React-based frontend applications easy and effective. With over fifty thousand stars on GitHub (51.5k as at the time of this writing), Gatsby stands as one of the most widely used React frameworks. Gatsby is so popular that most hosting platforms offer custom support for the framework. Netlify is one of those platforms.

                                A key goal for any DevOps team is to shorten the software development cycle and provide continuous delivery of high-quality software. Instead of continuing to the next logical goal, continuous deployment, most companies stop here. Developed code reaches the testing phase automatically, then, successful testing triggers a manual acceptance step. Only then is the application deployed into production. It is also important to maintain a DevOps mindset as you take this project on.

                                Software is one of the most complex tools invented for practical use. One misplaced character can break an entire application. So, careful testing is an essential requirement before publishing any code. In this article, you will learn about two fundamental types of software testing, unit testing and integration testing , and how your team can implement them in your CI/CD pipelines to validate your code quickly and deliver new features to your users with confidence.

In that previous discussion, we mentioned Flower (a “friendly” federated learning framework). Well, one of the creators of Flower, Daniel Beutel, agreed to join us on the show to discuss the project (and federated learning more broadly)! The result is a really interesting and motivating discussion of ML, privacy, distributed training, and open source AI.

If your subscribers, event handlers, or consumers are not keeping up, we’ll hold the messages till they are ready. Bugs made it past your integration test? Not to worry: just seek back and replay .  But, you had to worry a little: until today, you had up to a week to fix the code and process everything. This gives you more time to debug subscribers.

                                With the widespread adoption of containers among organizations, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard to deploy and operate containerized applications. As you expand your Kubernetes footprint, creating and enforcing consistent configurations and security policies across your growing fleet can create friction.  As the famous adage goes “show, don&#39;t tell. And we’ll use Policy Controller for the enforcement of programmable policies that represent constraints on the desired state.

                                With event-driven architectures, it’s quite common to read events from a source in one region or project and route them to a destination in another region or another project. Let’s take a look at how you can implement cross-region and cross-project event routing in Google Cloud. Cross-region event routing is straightforward in Google Cloud, whether you’re using Pub/Sub directly or Eventarc. Pub/Sub routes messages globally.  Cross-project event routing is also a non-issue in Pub/Sub...

                                What is CI/CD? Continuous Integration (CI), at its core, is about getting feedback early and often, which makes it possible to identify and correct problems early in the development process. With CI, you integrate your work frequently, often multiple times a day, instead of waiting for one large integration later on. Each integration is verified with an automated build, which enables you to detect integration issues as quickly as possible and reduce problems downstream.dev
