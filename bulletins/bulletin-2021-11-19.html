                        So a couple of weeks ago I wrote Finding Alloy’s Niche , where I said I wasn’t expecting the new Alloy 6 release to change all that much. It came out last Tuesday, I tried it out, figuring that I’d update the Alloydocs in mid-December or so. Totally unrelated : I was planning on uploading a TLA&#43; post to the blog today, it’s 99% finished, but I didn’t bother because I need to get an Alloy post out right frickin’ now. 1 Because as of last Tuesday all existing Alloy learning material is obsolete.

                        To implement its safety guarantees, the Rust compiler keeps careful track of ownership and references throughout a program. This makes writing certain kinds of data structures challenging; in particular, data structures that have circular references. These boxes are wrapped in an Option because a node&#39;s left or right child might be empty. Now suppose we want to add a parent link to every node. At the same time, the new child&#39;s parent link is a reference to the node. Centralize the ownership (e..

                        The Bug in Paxos Made Simple There&#39;s not really a bug in Paxos, but clickbait is fun. Over the last few weeks, I&#39;ve been picking up the excellent P programming language , a language for modelling and specifying distributed systems. One of the first things I did in P was implement Paxos - an algorithm I know well, has a lot of subtle failure modes, and is easy to get wrong. Perfect for practicing specification. I mentioned this to a colleague who said they had never heard of this bug. 8.

NewSQL followed NoSQL to amend things and restore balance to the force. NewSQL is a class of modern relational DBMSs that seek to provide on-par scalability to NoSQL for OLTP read-write workloads while still maintaining ACID guarantees for transactions.

                        I guess I know something about train wrecks. One night when I was 10 years old, me and my mom were driving home. We came to a train crossing outside of town. There was another car stopped right on the tracks, stalled. A lady was inside, trying to get her car to start. It didn’t. Train crossings are bumpy, cars were worse then, it was a long time ago, I don’t know, I don’t remember clearly. We heard the whistle of an arriving train. I just didn’t get to see it. I was boggled. I have no idea why..

Reading that book is what taught me that business success is not just a result of luck or hard work. Strategy matters too. I bet I could math this. Let&#39;s reformulate the question.

(for example nginx playground , sql playground , this dns lookup tool , and a couple of others) My general approach to frontend development has been pretty “pretend it’s 2005” – I usually have an index.html file, a script.js file, and then I do a &lt;script src=&#34;script.js&#34;&gt; and that’s it. You can see an example of that approach here . But I haven’t been using them.md vue.common.

                        AIOps is an approach to managing the exponential growth of IT operations and the complexity of new technology through the application of artificial intelligence (AI). IT infrastructure increasingly relies on complicated deployments, multi-cloud architectures, and huge amounts of data. Traditionally, the tech industry responds to complexity by applying extra brainpower to the problem, bringing in more engineers, developers, and management. Take cloud misconfiguration, for example.

In this tutorial, I will show you how you can easily write and run tests using Flask and Pytest. I will cover these tasks: Setting up Pytest on a Flask app Writing Pytest tests Grouping tests As a bonus, we will also integrate a CI/CD pipeline to run tests on a Flask app using CircleCI.txt from the root folder of the project. Why use Flask? Flask is a lightweight micro-web framework written in Python.data....

                        Passwords are everywhere. Sometimes they are obvious — hardcoded in the code or laying flat in the file. Other times, they take the form of API keys, tokens, cookies or even second factors. Devs pass them in environment variables, vaults mount them on disk, teams share them over links, copy to CI/CD systems and code linters. Eventually someone leaks, intercepts or steals them. Because they pose a security risk, there is no other way to say it: passwords in our infrastructure have to go.

                        Hardware security modules (HSM) and trusted platform modules (TPM) seemingly do the same thing: they manage secret keys and enable data protection. But what does “managing secrets” mean, and what’s the difference between the two? Before diving deeper, let’s explore why computers need help with managing their secrets. What are TPMs and HSMs for? Sensitive data needs to be protected, that is why data centers employ physical security. An attacker must also know the secret to decrypt the data.g.

The length of development is influenced by a number of factors, such as scale, development platform, scope, and type of game. Gamers often expect global multiplayer experiences on Day 1, which means that the success of a game can depend on how well it can scale to a community of millions of players in the first few weeks of its life. In other words, momentum is everything.
