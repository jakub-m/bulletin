Or maybe you are currently wondering how to test a new feature that you have been entrusted to implement? Nothing is more frustrating than code that we cannot control, and over time it becomes so troublesome that no one bothers about it too much.

You can use subnet routers in Tailscale to easily connect an existing network you have to your tailnet—for example, a virtual private cloud, or an on-premises legacy network. To set up a subnet router, you advertise routes from the device, and then approve these from the admin console. But what if you’re spinning up multiple subnet routers in high-availability mode ? Or multiple exit nodes ? We’re introducing the concepts of autoApprovers for routes and exit nodes.

LinkedIn launched in its initial form over 18 years ago, which is an eternity in the technology world. The early site was a single monolithic Java web application, and as it gained in popularity and the user base grew, the underlying technology had to adapt in order to support our ever-growing scale. We now operate well over 1,000 separate microservices running on the JVM, and each has its own set of operational challenges when it comes to operating at scale.

This is the first of an unbounded and weakly-ordered series of posts aimed at developers coming to Rust from a JavaScript/TypeScript background. It’s “for web devs” because my imagined reader is a web developer, but it’s not about web development. Nor is it meant to be a comprehensive introduction to Rust, just a series of essays on the parts I find interesting. If you’re brand new to Rust, you might want to start with The Book or Rust in Action.

Two people need to capture the magic of aligning what they bring to the table with what the other is seeking. It’s an opaque, situation-specific dance, not an algebra equation that you can crank through. In this post we’ll lay out some of the most important enterprise features to add to your product. Retrofitting your product to support this can be painful.

Crypto faces a major barrier when it comes to mainstream adoption: The user journey is complicated and not yet built-out, and it’s not at all easy or intuitive for people new to crypto to even do the simplest possible thing — hold complete control over their own digital assets. Of course, it’s not required that... Read More The post The Missing Link Between Web2 and Web3: Custody appeared first on Future .

Posted by AJ Piergiovanni and Anelia Angelova, Research Scientists, Google Research While not immediately obvious, all of us experience the world in four dimensions (4D). For example, when walking or driving down the street we observe a stream of visual inputs, snapshots of the 3D world, which, when taken together in time, creates a 4D visual input. This means that far-away objects might only get a handful of points, or none at all, and might not be seen by LiDAR alone.e.e.

Hello! Here are some things you may or may not have noticed about DNS: when you resolve a DNS name in a Python program, it checks /etc/hosts , but when you use dig , it doesn’t. switching Linux distributions can sometimes change how your DNS works, for example if you use Alpine Linux instead of Ubuntu it can cause problems. There are a bunch of surprising-to-me things about getaddrinfo , and once I learned about them, it explained a bunch of the confusing DNS behaviour I’d seen in the past.168.

Not all of them are equally “easy”, but I found reading the list really fun and it gave me some ideas for things to learn.

It’s hard to believe that it’s only been about 5 years since the term ‘GitOps’ was coined by Alexis Richardson , CEO of Weaveworks. GitOps is a comparatively new technology, and it still is gaining a lot of interest at every container and cloud-native conference. That’s what we’ve put together in our latest guide - ‘GitOps for Absolute Beginners. From here, you’ll get a clear understanding of what GitOps actually is as defined by the official GitOps governance group - OpenGitOps.

Kubernetes gained popularity as it simplifies the scalability and management of containerized applications. It enables you to deploy and manage nodes, pods, containers, services, and configuration maps across the entire application lifecycle. It was difficult to achieve such flexibility and control with scripts. But thanks to Kubernetes’ declarative approach to infrastructure, you can define precise changes at any scale. However, Helm’s scope goes beyond templating. Chart.yaml.

Yesterday, I put forth a bunch of API possibilities for the problem of needing to return a value but also indicating the lack of a value and being able to comment on why. In it, the notion of a &#34;wrapper&#34; around a string was presented, such that it might look like &#34;Result&lt;string&gt;&#34;, and those brackets started looking like a pain. I wanted the Result behavior, but didn&#39;t want to deal with templates and those brackets everywhere, or the duplication of code behind the scenes. Now, resultstr.value()..

If you agree with the notion that you need to be able to tell the difference between the absence of a value and a value itself, then this has some impacts on the code you write. If you want to keep &#39;em separated (so they can come out and play), then it gets you looking at your API designs in certain ways. These are my reactions to some of the ways a value can be returned (or not). It&#39;s probably a CGI program, but it could also be buried inside some much bigger thing, too... Only then is ...

To help handle the surge, and keep up with heightened customer demands, many customer experience providers have deployed automation in the form of virtual agents that serve as the first—and, sometimes the last—line of customer support. This approach is not conducive to achieving lower average handle times (or AHT), reduced processing errors, or increased customer satisfaction.

## [Developing high-quality ML solutions](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/guidelines-for-developing-quality-ml-solutions/)


When a deployed ML model produces poor predictions, it can be due to a wide range of problems. It can be the result of bugs that are typical in any program—but it can also be the result of ML-specific problems. Perhaps data skews and anomalies are causing model performance to degrade over time. Or the data format is inconsistent between the model’s native interface and the serving API. If  models aren&#39;t monitored, they can fail silently. This duality can result in training-serving skew.

## [New benchmarks for securing Chrome from the Center for Internet Security](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/new-benchmarks-securing-chrome-center-internet-security/)


As the way people work continues to evolve, keeping security policies in place that protect organizations but give workers the ability to get things done is more important than ever. IT and security teams must aim to stay a step ahead of web-based security threats that come their organization’s way. To help, the Center for Internet Security (CIS ) team has released the latest CIS Benchmark 2.1 for Google Chrome . Any labeled Level 1, are considered to be a good baseline for an organization.

## [Compose for the Maps SDK for Android Now Available](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/compose-maps-sdk-android-now-available/)


Today, we are excited to share an open source library, Maps Compose , which enables you to use the Maps SDK for Android alongside Jetpack Compose . Previously, adding a map to your app with Compose entailed writing a lot of View interoperability code to bridge between Compose and the View-based MapView. Now, you no longer need to do that. Compose is Android’s declarative, modern native UI toolkit. The same is true for Maps Compose, you can now add a map in your Android app with much less code.
