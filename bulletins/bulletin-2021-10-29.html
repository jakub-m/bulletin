                        Let&#39;s talk about bug/feature tradeoffs. Anyone who knows me has probably already heard me rant about Crossing the Chasm , my most favourite business book of all time. I love its simple explanation of market segmentation and why the life cycle of a tech startup so often goes the way it does. Reading that book is what taught me that business success is not just a result of luck or hard work. Strategy matters too. I bet I could math this. Let&#39;s reformulate the question. And that way lies drama.

                        Developers have strong tendencies to automate repetitive tasks, and this applies to writing code as well. Therefore, the topic of metaprogramming is a hot area of development and research, and hails back to Lisp in the 1960s. One specific aspect of metaprogramming that has been particularly useful is code-generation , or writing programs that emit other programs, or parts of themselves.g. C&#43;&#43; template metaprogramming ). The go generate command has been introduced all the way back in Go 1./.../..

                        What the research is:  Kangaroo is a new flash cache that enables more efficient caching of tiny objects (objects that are ~100 bytes or less) and overcomes the challenges presented by existing flash cache designs. Since Kangaroo is implemented within CacheLib, Facebook’s open source caching engine, developers can use Kangaroo through CacheLib’s API to build [...] Read More...

Nearly 90% of professionals say that the pandemic caused them to reevaluate their priorities in work and life, and as a result, many are looking for new opportunities.

                        Sup nerds! Last week the SPLASH conference— the main academic conference for programming language research— came to town. I decided on a whim to buy a ticket and go. It was definitely a different experience than an industry conference! Each slot was 3-4 papers back to back, followed by questions on all of them at once. Most of it went over my head, given 1) it’s an academic conference and 2) it’s in a field I barely know. Also I was the only person without a university affiliation.read_csv(&#39;foo.

                        This blog post started as a seasonal message from our Newsletter. We’ve expanded it to be appropriate for the rest of the year. With more employees changing jobs in 2021 than ever before, there are likely to be a few skeletons in the closet. As we approach October 31st, I wanted to dig into the History of Halloween. The Celts believed that on this night of the year, the boundary between the world of the living and dead became blurred. When ghosts of the dead return to earth.

                        Often you will see mention of full-stack developers, and almost as often you will see rejoinders: what level of proficiency in the different areas of the stack do you require to describe yourself as “full-stack”? For individuals with a wide spread of knowledge, I wonder if a better framing is around self-sufficiency. As a self-sufficient developer I know a few things well, but I know enough about the other levels of the stack that I work in to get by.”  ↩︎

In veel landen gaan de cijfers omhoog. In de UK zijn ze al tijden en tijden torenhoog. De vaccins houden goed stand tegen ernstige ziekte (zie verderop). Maar of de cijfers nog veel verder omhoog zullen gaan, ik durf het niet te zeggen.

                         There were several AMAs at SOSP21, where the attendees can ask questions. I really like Jon Howell &#39;s AMA session. I asked two questions I was interested about learning.   Why do you think verification is at a breakaway point now? What are the factors that make this the go-big moment? We are now figuring out how to make common problems cheap. Historically Coq proving was about being clever: do something not done before. Now we are focusing on how do we make the common stuff cheap... taste.

SOSP was held biannually; I had attended SOSP19 in person, and shared notes and paper summaries from that.  This year SOSP is virtual, which made it a lot easier to travel to. It is nice attending the conference from the convenience of your home. The experience is not too inferior to physical conference attending if you take the convenience factor into account.  Here are some notes from SOSP21.3 reviews per artifact.github.

                        <div class="description">
                        As you’re building your application, you want to ensure that your customers have a bug-free user experience as much as possible. Since bugs show up most often when new code is deployed, your deployment process should be set up to catch bugs or regressions early and then quickly deploy patches into production before those bugs affect users. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline is of course a great first step. This is where canary deployment comes in. Let’s take a look at how they work.

                        One thing that bash is excellent at is manipulating strings of text. If you’re at the command line or writing a small script, then knowing some bash string idioms can be a lot of help. So in this article, I’m going to go over techniques for working with strings in bash. You can run any of the examples at the bash prompt: &gt; echo &#34;test&#34; test Or you can put the same commands into a file with a bash shebang.sh &gt; ./strings. If not, know that everything covered will work in bash version 3. So create.

                        Computing has reached an unprecedented point in speed, capability, storage, and scale, elevating user expectations for product innovation. To deliver against constantly evolving business goals, software development must embrace practices that prioritize shorter iterative cycles, tighter feedback loops, and delivery velocity so that code can ship quickly and more often to end users. Though closely related, CI, and CD are not exactly the same things. They include: Source control. Quality gates.

However, there may be instances when learning from many related tasks at the same time would lead to better modeling performance.e. Overview of TAG.

                        When you’re developing software, you need to access all kinds of resources, including package registries, container image registries, databases, and other network services. You want to work with those services securely and with low latency, wherever they are, even if they’re behind a firewall or don’t have a public IP address. From a development workspace in Coder, you can access resources you need for development, and share what you’re working with your coworkers with Tailscale.

                        Have you moved to a remote development environment? In reality, you can rarely develop fully in isolation—you need access to internal tools and services to make sure your code works as expected. So although your development environment moved, well, it’s likely nothing else did. If you already didn’t have a great way to access internal development resources before, then having an ephemeral VM in a cloud provider spinning up and down as you need it for development doesn’t make that any easier.

It could be a coffee shop, the train, or even (gasp!) the office. In an ideal world, it shouldn’t take longer to gain access to what you need to get your work done, including cloud and on-prem resources, than it does to complete the tasks at hand. Developing remotely should be a boon, not a bottleneck, that’s why we’re excited to partner with Gitpod . That’s it—you’re connected.

                        What would you build if you could treat your network infrastructure programmatically? That’s what we’re going to consider in today’s sponsored Heavy Networking episode with Nokia. Nokia’s SR-Linux is infrastructure-as-code friendly, and their NetOps Development Kit allows you to think of the network as data models and build all kinds of useful tools. Our guest is Bruce Wallis, Senior Director of Product Management in Data Center Switching at Nokia.

What is a personal retrospective? Retrospectives are a well-established resource in the software and systems engineering toolbox. From sprint retros through to post-incident reviews , we look back on our work to learn from it and to get better. We could look over a whole year of work, or focus more closely on a particular project. 1.g. 2. 3. 4.

                        For the latest full-stack applications to work, a backend service is required. That is especially true when the frontend service depends on the backend service to render data. In many cases, it can be difficult to replicate the setup of the backend services so that you can test the application. This tutorial will show you how to mock HTTP requests from an API so that you can test endpoints without actually calling them in your tests.spec. Essentially, you “mock up” the backend application.16.to.

                        The introduction of Git as a source-code management system in 2005 fundamentally transformed the process of software development. Git allows developers to maintain a history of changes, or commits, to their code and revert to previous commits in seconds if something goes wrong. It makes collaboration easier by allowing branching to keep code for different features separate and seamlessly merging commits by various people. However, learning Git is more complicated than learning SVN or CVS.

In this post, I will guide you through using Joi as a library to create API contracts for services consuming an API.js installed on your system (version &gt;= 11.js .coindesk.json .coindesk.16....

So, for example, (5)3 = 5*6*7 and […] The post Foreshadowing hypergeometric functions first appeared on John D. Cook .

I didn’t do a post on double factorials because they are more common. But an example I ran into recently changed my mind.
