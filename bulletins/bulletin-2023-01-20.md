As we took a few days away from our keyboards over the holidays, we here at Tailscale also spent time reflecting on the year we had in 2022, which seemed to come and go before we knew it. It was quite a journey — and we wanted to share with you some highlights from what was a decidedly lively and groundbreaking year for us. On the product front, we launched a host of new features and upgrades to make Tailscale even more magical. We thank you — and we are excited to step into 2023 with you.

Software organizations’ three core business aspirations are application quality, team productivity, and cost optimization. This led them away from the waterfall style of software development towards DevOps - something that began about a decade ago. This move added significant value to software delivery by breaking silos between developers and IT operations teams. DevOps has become widely popular, but there’s a flip side to it.  A developer self-service platform can overcome this roadblock.

This article was discussed on Hacker News . In my common SDL2 mistakes listing , the first was about winging it instead of using the sdl2-config script. It’s just one of three official options for portably configuring SDL2, but I had dismissed the others from consideration. One is the pkg-config facility common to unix-like systems. However, the SDL maintainers recently announced SDL3, which will not have a sdl3-config . The concept has been deprecated in favor of the existing pkg-config option.

The better you are, the faster you go. That&#39;s a basic truism of just about any field, and programming is no different. But competence isn&#39;t the only input to pace. Risk tolerance is just as important, if not more so. You can&#39;t go quickly if you treat every problem with the diligence required for rocket surgery. If your work can directly kill people, think guided missiles or pacemakers, you damn well better put all your emphasis on safety. The criticality ladder keeps going down from there.

Most people who operate DDoS-for-hire services attempt to hide their true identities and location. Proprietors of these so-called “booter” or “stresser” services — designed to knock websites and users offline — have long operated in a legally murky area of cybercrime law. And then there are booter store operators like John Dobbs, a 32-year-old computer science graduate student living in Honolulu, Hawaii.

I’ve recently been real fascinated by the topic of complexity and what keeps us from keeping software simple. The wider net likes to blame “lazy programmers” and “evil managers” for this, as if any software could, with sufficient time, be made as simple as “hello world”. I’ve instead been looking at how various factors create complexity “pressure”. Code that needs to satisfy a physical constraint is more likely to be complex than code that doesn’t, etc. And there’s a problem with that.  ↩

His approach consisted of essentially leveraging the randomness of a user’s private key to ensure each identifier is unique. A disadvantage Bill pointed out with this is that a user may forget their private key and ultimately lose access to their account.

Introduction When an API requires implementation details from the user, many developers use an interface for help. However, another way to allow developers to provide implementation details for an API is to accept a function instead. Go supports declaring function types which can be used to define a contract similar to how interfaces define a contract. A good example of an API that uses functions over an interface is the HTTP package.

Hello! A few days back we talked about problems with floating point numbers . This got me thinking – but what about integers? Of course integers have all kinds of problems too – anytime you represent a number in a small fixed amount of space (like 8/16/32/64 bits), you’re going to run into problems. So I asked on Mastodon again for examples of integer problems and got all kinds of great responses again. Here’s a table of contents. what’s going on? 0 - 1 is equal to the 4 bytes 0xFFFFFFFF .....0.

## [How to do multivariate time series forecasting in BigQuery ML](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-to-do-multivariate-time-series-forecasting-in-bigquery-ml/)


Companies across industries rely heavily on time series forecasting to project product demand, forecast sales, project online subscription/cancellation, and for many other use cases. This makes time series forecasting one of the most popular models in BigQuery ML.  What is multivariate time series forecasting? For example, if you want to forecast ice cream sales, it is helpful to forecast using the external covariant “weather” along with the target metric “past sales. based on cohort age.e. 1.

Canary deployment is an advanced technique used to test changes in a production environment by gradually rolling out the changes to a small subset of users before fully deploying them to the entire user base. This allows for real-world testing of the changes, and the ability to quickly roll back the changes in the event of any issues. Canary deployments are particularly useful for testing changes to critical parts of an application, such as new features or updates to the database schema.pkg.pkg.

In addition to storage-level encryption, whether using Google-managed or customer-managed keys , BigQuery also provides column-level encryption . While BigQuery provides column-level encryption in the cloud, many organizations operate in hybrid-cloud environments.

Editor’s note : Google Cloud supports a wide range of IPv6 capabilities. For an overview, check out this blog . When people talk about the IPv4 Address exhaustion problem, it’s usually in the context of the  public IPv4 space. When IPv6 was introduced, the primary goal was to fix the address exhaustion problem by allocating internet-accessible addresses to every device. However, IP exhaustion issues in large enterprises are often related to the private RFC1918 address space .  1. 2. Read Article

Transforming the customer experience of insurance claims processing is a key driver for transforming the insurance claims process itself. This needs a holistic approach to addressing different aspects of the claims processing workflow and modernizing the data that claims processing heavily relies on. Transforming claims processing can help reduce the manual touches from the process and lower processing time and costs, resulting in reduced claims’ payouts and higher policyholder satisfaction...

When a software change is deployed — after being designed, coded, tested, packaged, and tested some more — a journey comes to an end. At the same time, a new journey begins: your customer’s relationship with your service. It’s here, in the domain of operations, that abstract risks like launch schedule slippage give way to tangible risks like lost revenue, degraded trust, and tarnished reputation. Software delivery relies on a foundation of reliability to create value.

For organizations, it is important to build a data lake solution that offers flexible governance and the ability to break data silos while maintaining a simple and manageable data infrastructure that does not require multiple copies of the same data. This is particularly true for organizations trying to empower multiple data science teams to run workloads like demand forecasting or anomaly detection on the data lake. This leads to data duplication and the creation of new data silos.
