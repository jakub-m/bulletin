## [Good Managers Write Good](https://staysaasy.com/management/2022/07/10/Writing-Management.html)


In my time observing managers, one observation seems to repeat again and again: good managers write well, and bad managers write poorly. In fact, the best managers I’ve ever seen were not just good writers, they were terrific. And the worst managers I’ve ever had were not just bad writers, they were uncommonly bad. I’ve started to reflect more on why this might be the case, as well as the implications of this trend. To be a good manager, you must be able to do the same. Writing is the opposite.

You want to be able to measure how many incremental conversions different channels and touchpoints are successfully driving. The best practice of A/B tests at individual level is not applicable in traditional channels such as TV ads, radios, or billboards.

I got 1,000 words into “what, exactly, is software complexity” before remembering that this is supposed to be less effort than the blog. So instead I’m going to list some ideas I had for programming languages. I think all of these are technically doable, so it’s more a “nobody else wants this badly enough” thing. The canonical example is withdrawing from a bank account: method withdraw(amnt: int) requires amnt &lt;= self.balance ensures self.balance &gt;= 0 { self.. Stuff like that.  ↩

Sinds een tijdje maak ik grafiekjes van hoe Nederland aan z’n elektriciteit komt. En soms ben ik daar dan enthousiast over, zeker als de wind waait en de zon goed schijnt. Het blijkt dat we nu soms voldoende groene elektriciteit hebben om onszelf een paar uur geheel groen te bedruipen. En vaak hebben we dan ook nog hele gigawatten over om te exporteren naar het buitenland: Mijn enthousiasme leidt dan weleens tot de vraag “maar wat nou als het donker is”.

It won&#39;t be able to do filters, mapping, etc. $ cat large-file.json | head -n2 | ./jqgo &#39;.repo.url&#39; &#34;https://api.github.com/repos/petroav/6.828&#34; &#34;https://api.github.com/repos/rspt/rspt-theme&#34; We&#39;ll start by building a &#34;control&#34; implementation that uses Go&#39;s builtin JSON library with a JSON path tool on top.

A comprehensive introduction to writing an interpreter for a dynamically typed, object-oriented toy programming language (Lox). Throughout the book the author develops two complete interpreters for the language from start to finish, including all the front-end and backend parts. The first is a simple AST walking interpreter implemented in Java, and the second is a moderately optimized VM written in C, including a garbage collector. It will work. First, the book is enormous . Long, large, heavy.

It’s inconsistent, since human errors are inevitable, and can cause unwanted discrepancies between stacks. If you already know Python, Java, Node.js, Go, or .dynamodb.

Progressive delivery is a long-standing practice that builds on the capabilities of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) to help organizations get more control over software rollout. With it, we are able to limit the potential negative impact on user engagement when releasing new product features. While the idea makes sense, progressive delivery is a complex mechanism if done manually. This can become tedious and error prone.

## [Track, compare, manage experiments with Vertex AI Experiments](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/track-compare-manage-experiments-vertex-ai-experiments/)


Managing experiments is one of the main challenges for data science teams.  Finding the best modeling approach that works for a particular problem requires both hypothesis testing and trial-and-error. Tracking development and outcomes using docs and spreadsheets is neither reliable nor easy to share. Consequently the process of ML development is severely affected.  Indeed, not having a tracking service leads to manual copy/pasting of the parameters and metrics.  Figure 1.data. Figure 2.Artifact.
