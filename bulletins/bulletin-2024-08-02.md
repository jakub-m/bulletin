## [Reversing Samsung Metadata](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1039-Reversing-Samsung-Metadata.html)


When people talk about metadata, the focus is usually on tracking and privacy, or storing information like camera settings, copyright, authorship, or file handling. However, if the purpose of metadata is to record and provide information, then why are so many metadata fields treated as proprietary content? I mean, some metadata formats are open and public and well-defined. These include EXIF, XMP, MPF, and ICC Profiles. However, other types of metadata are not publicly disclosed.................

## [Finding acoustical delight in THE THOCK](https://world.hey.com/dhh/finding-acoustical-delight-in-the-thock-aa84f70b)


Before diving into the world of mechanical keyboards, I&#39;d never heard the word &#34;thock&#34; before. But I soon learned that it describes one of those strangely seductive sounds you can produce from pressing the keys on a keyboard tuned for acoustical joy. And now, dammit, I&#39;ve acquired a taste for this type of ear candy, and I can&#39;t stop smiling as I type with a tune. Thock isn&#39;t the only type of sound that connoisseurs of keyboard acoustics clamor for, mind you. But there goes the misconception.

## [Unified Grid: How We Re-Architected Slack for Our Largest Customers](https://slack.engineering/unified-grid-how-we-re-architected-slack-for-our-largest-customers/)


All software is built atop a core set of assumptions. As new code is added and new use-cases emerge, software can become unmoored from those assumptions. When this happens, a fundamental tension arises between revisiting those foundational assumptions—which usually entails a lot of work—or trying to support new behavior atop the existing architecture. The latter […] The post Unified Grid: How We Re-Architected Slack for Our Largest Customers appeared first on Slack Engineering .

Our new paper Resource management in Aurora Serverless 1 describes what this looks like in context of a large-scale running system: Amazon Aurora Serverless . So they eat all the memory available to them.

Do you ever wonder how a package ordered halfway across the world gets to you on time? Or how do shipping companies manage the daunting process of transporting goods globally with minimal mistakes? The secret behind streamlined transport processes is technology. Based on a survey by McKinsey , investing in basic technologies like transport management and warehouse management systems helps shipping companies stay ahead of the competition. This is a guest post by the wonderful Lucy Rose.

I took my annual summer break earlier this week, and three things happened. Email never stopped coming in. Backlogs were created. I ate too much. This happens every year. And there, in those four words, the answer to this dilemma lies. It’s a recurring dilemma. Do I spend time on my break doing work, or do I switch off and deal with everything when I return home? That’s your only choice unless you are fortunate to have some kind colleagues to help you while you are away.

When Japan’s space agency, JAXA, set out to make its first lunar landing in January, the goal wasn’t just to get its SLIM (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) spacecraft on the moon’s surface. The plan also called to touch down within 100 meters of its intended target — making for the world’s first pinpoint lunar landing. JAXA’s doubly historic moment came on Jan. 19, 2024, as Japan became the fifth country to put a spacecraft on the moon. You can check out the full session on YouTube below.g.

In the previous blog post in this two-part series, we discussed the critical signals you need to monitor in your Kubernetes environment to ensure optimal resource provisioning. These signals include high CPU and memory utilization, frequent pod evictions, slow application performance, and other indicators that your resources are over- or under-provisioned. Monitoring these signals is essential for maintaining an efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable Kubernetes environment.

Organizations that run Kubernetes clusters in cloud native environments should do so in a way that’s both operationally efficient and cost effective. However, many organizations don’t prioritize cost optimization until it becomes a pressing need. This may be due to a directive from senior leadership, a significant scale-up or migration of Kubernetes clusters, or an unexpected surge in the cloud bill. For some types of workloads—like a non-spiky, non-SLA workload—this would be completely fine.

In April 2024, Nature released detailed information about investigations into claims made by Ranga Dias, a physicist at the University of Rochester, in two high-profile papers the journal had published about the discovery of room-temperature superconductivity. Those two papers, which showed evidence of fabricated data, were eventually retracted, along with other papers from the Dias…

Senate hearings, a post office ban, the resignation of the director of the National Bureau of Standards, and his reinstatement after more than 400 scientists threatened to resign. Who knew a little box of salt could stir up such drama? What was AD-X2? It all started in 1947 when a bulldozer operator with a 6th grade education, Jess M. Ritchie, teamed up with UC Berkeley chemistry professor Merle Randall to promote AD-X2 , an additive to extend the life of lead-acid batteries. Jess M.S.S.S. Mr.C.

Ten years. Two countries. Multiple redesigns. Some US $80 million invested. And, finally, Zero Zero Robotics has a product it says is ready for consumers, not just robotics hobbyists—the HoverAir X1 . The company has sold several hundred thousand flying cameras since the HoverAir X1 started shipping last year. It hasn’t gotten the millions of units into consumer hands—or flying above them—that its founders would like to see, but it’s a start. “It’s been like a 10-year-long Ph.D.D.

And she put that typewriter through its paces. Just like Perry herself.

I’ll be honest: when I first got this pitch for an autonomous robot dentist, I was like: “Okay, I’m going to talk to these folks and then write an article, because there’s no possible way for this thing to be anything but horrific.” Then they sent me some video that was, in fact, horrific, in the way that only watching a high speed drill remove most of a tooth can be. But fundamentally this has very little to do with robotics, because getting your teeth drilled just sucks no matter what.

You have a closed box. There may be a live cat inside, but you won’t know until you open the box. For most people, this situation is a theoretical conundrum that probes the foundations of quantum mechanics. For me, however, it’s a pressing practical problem, not least because physics completely skates over the vital issue of how annoyed the cat will be when the box is opened. Perhaps I should back up a little bit. A removable lid on top allows us to replace straw bedding every few months.

One is finding a testbed where they can run experiments with their new hardware and software. The experimentation platforms, which resemble real-world conditions, can be pricey. Some have a time limit. Others may be used only by specific companies or for testing certain technologies.

The Large Hadron Collider has transformed our understanding of physics since it began operating in 2008, enabling researchers to investigate the fundamental building blocks of the universe. Some 100 meters below the border between France and Switzerland, particles accelerate along the LHC’s 27-kilometer circumference, nearly reaching the speed of light before smashing together. The LHC is often described as the biggest machine ever built.D. “You’re part of something that is very huge,” she says.
