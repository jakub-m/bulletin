## [Five Nine Problems](https://specbranch.com/posts/five-nines/)


A guilty pleasure of mine is the pursuit of perfection. It is certainly a vice in most contexts, but there are some problems whose solutions demand a measure of perfection. These are problems that I will refer to as “5-9 problems”: problems whose solutions need five 9’s (or more) in some dimension. Usually, those nines are correctness of some kind, but they can also be availability or for some systems, speed.

## [How to Create a Python Virtual Environment with uv](https://earthly.dev/blog/python-uv/)


Imagine you have a Python 3.10 backend application with packages a2.1, b2.2, and c2.3 installed system-wide. Everything works fine until you start a new project that also uses Python 3.10 but needs a1.2, b2.2, and c2.1. Installing these new packages causes dependency issues with your first project because a2.1 and c2.3 are no longer available. If you start a third project requiring Python 3.8, you would need to downgrade Python, causing further conflicts.sh/uv/install.sh/uv/install.1.9.bat .26.

The drama around AI is bit ridiculous. It&#39;s going to revolutionize every business, cure disease, make us 8000% more productive, save the world. Also: it&#39;s going to steal every knowledge-worker&#39;s job, destroy the economy, and enslave civilization! The fact that everyone feels these things simultaneously makes it clear that it&#39;s not just a fad. I don&#39;t have to like it, but I&#39;m going to have to know when to use it, or perhaps when to defend against its abuse. I didn&#39;t have time to read the book.g..

Nothing gets me quite as fired up as discovering the future early and undistributed. That feeling of realizing that something is simply better, and the only reason it hasn&#39;t taken off yet is because the world hasn&#39;t realized it. It&#39;s amazing, and it&#39;s how I&#39;m feeling about Linux right now. That &#34;how did I not know it was this good&#34; sensation. I felt the same way about the Mac back in 2001. And Ruby in 2003. And company chat with Campfire in 2005. It&#39;s about seeing that end state. A new dawn.

Just an unordered collections of thoughts on this. In programming languages, nondeterminism tends to come from randomness, concurrency, or external forces (like user input or other systems). In specification languages, we also have nondeterminism as a means of abstraction . Say we&#39;re checking if a user submitted the correct password. A software implementation might look something like this: # pythonish def attempt_login ( user , pw ): submitted_hash = hash_password ( pw ) actual_hash = db ...9 .

How to manage GoRoutines using a parent-child relationship model to prevent orphan GoRoutines.

Some of the most interesting technical blog posts I read come from, and a common reason for posts I write is, confusion. You&#39;re at work and you start asking questions that are difficult to answer. You spend a few hours or a day trying to get to the bottom of things. If you ask a question to very experienced and successful developers at work, they have a tendency not to give context and to simplify things down to a single answer. This may be a good way to make business decisions. Write it down.

When it comes to career growth, managers and companies often make the mistake of trying to focus on everyone, all at the same time. This error usually happens when a manager or company goes through a revamp of their career growth framework. It looks like this: Something catalyzes a push for career growth. This can be feedback from the team, or the introduction of a new manager or a new leader in HR. The mandate: everyone needs a career plan. Then life happens. Don’t do this. Then create a plan.

When I first started working with AI, I was surprised at how complex and unstructured the development process was. Where traditional software development follows a widely agreed-upon streamlined process for developing and deploying, ML development is quite different. You need to think about and improve the data, the model, and the code, which adds layers…

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications that can communicate in human language seem to capture our attention whilst simultaneously blunting our critical capabilities. Examples of this abound, ranging from claims of AI sentience to apps that are “always here to listen and talk.”    Indeed, a key reason for the huge reach of Large Language Models (LLMs) is […]

My long-awaited book, Your Time, Your Way, will be published this Saturday. It is the fruition of a little over three years of work. From planning to writing the first draft, finding a publisher, and editing, publishing a book is hard but rewarding work. Writing this book has confirmed a few productivity lessons that border on laws and can help you with bigger, long-term projects. Anything you want to do will require more time than you plan for. It’s taken nearly forty months. It worked.

At the same time, when your business is constantly functioning at breakneck speed, hurdles to productivity and efficiency can also arise. The wonderful Katie Brenneman writes this week’s article. Thank you, Katie, for writing this for me. The key is to find a workable balance here. For solid organisation.

Each time someone interacts with a large language model (LLM), there is an energy cost in running the model for inference. In addition, there is an energy cost in the preparation and training of the model before it was brought to production. It is relatively easy to look at these costs in terms of kilowatt-hours […]

In recent years, “the biggest needs we’ve heard from our customers have been to make it easier to understand their observability data, to extend observability into the application layer, and to get deeper, contextualized analytics,” said Tom Wilkie, CTO of Grafana Labs, at ObservabilityCON 2023. In response to that, last year, we introduced Grafana Cloud Application Observability , an opinionated, out-of-the-box solution designed to improve the reliability of modern applications.cluster.

Many organizations use incident response setups that enable them to page on-call personnel via calling or sending a message to a phone number. In this guide, you will learn how to configure such a system by using Grafana OnCall .  For practical purposes, we’ll pair it with Twilio, though the same basic workflow should be applicable to other platforms. We will start with a basic setup that uses a phone number in Twilio to both call and send SMS messages to a webhook integration in Grafana OnCall.

Observing that, we identified a very interesting trend: the lack of migration from 5.7 to 8.x, or better yet, the need of many to remain on 5.7.  That observation has triggered several actions from […]

A power authority would pay its customers? It sounded like magic: useful and valuable electricity extracted from simple sunlight. In 2013 Chen earned a Ph.D.D.D.D.D.”
