## [FAIR: Allocating Resources Fairly at Scale](https://medium.com/@mihsathe/fair-allocating-resources-fairly-at-scale-8c3a54ecee35?source=rss-d9b1aeedecb1------2)


I recently published a Go library called FAIR , designed to maintain fair resource distribution using a randomized algorithm called stochastic fair BLUE with constant memory requirements. My vision for this project is to make it a “fit-and-forget” solution for most applications, requiring minimal tuning or operational overhead.

How often do you feel low on energy? Low energy is a near-daily experience for many due to prolonged fatigue, inadequate rest, and a diet high in processed sugary foods. People who feel their energy slipping often reach for a canned energy drink in search of a much-needed mental boost. The wonderful Katie Brenneman writes this week’s article. Thank you, Katie, for writing this for me. You can also change the way you structure your day . Diet also plays a key role in regulating.g.5–0.

Look, here&#39;s the thing, I don&#39;t like mysteries that involve technology. I think I hate them because I know that some other human created the thing I&#39;m staring at and, dammit, I should be able to understand it.  And, then one day I was browsing in one of those places where people leave books for others to take. I flipped through an old Portuguese book about computers published in the 1970s and two punched cards fell out. Nerd. Sniped. By. Gravity. Nope..pl 100170476 100170476 1 $ perl nif...

Windows paths have been WTF-16 -encoded for decades, but module names in the import tables of Portable Executable are octets. If a name contains values beyond ASCII — technically out of spec — then the dynamic linker must somehow decode those octets into Unicode in order to construct a lookup path. There are multiple ways this could be done, and the most obvious is the process’s active code page (ACP), which is exactly what happens. In this article I’ll contrive such a situation.dll .dll — i.e.

Forbes recently published the Forbes 400 List for 2024, listing the 400 richest people in the United States. This inspired me to make a histogram to show the distribution of wealth in the United States. It turns out that if you put Elon Musk on the graph, almost the entire US population is crammed into a vertical bar, one pixel wide. Each pixel is $500 million wide, illustrating that $500 million essentially rounds to zero from the perspective of the wealthiest Americans.

Linearizability is a strong consistency model in concurrent and distributed systems.

On first reading (and probably on the second and third...) this sounds a bit abstract, but it really is all there is to it. This post dives deeper into what this means in practice.

My first reaction when I heard that John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton had been awarded the Physics Nobel was – “aren’t there any advances in  physics that are, perhaps, more deserving?”  However, after a bit of reflection, I realised that this was a canny move on part of the Swedish Academy because it draws attention […]

It&#39;s no secret that my FotoForensics service bans users, some ISP providers, and even entire countries. The free service has some basic rules, and violating these rules results in bans: Rule #1: No pornography, nudity, or sexually explicit content. Rule #2: No ID photos, passports, or related personally identifiable information (PII). Rule #3: No bulk uploading, long-term analysis, or commercial use. Users who violate the rule are banned immediately. However, most bans expire after a few months.

Exceptions in Python is one of those areas that have a surface layer that most people know, and a deeper, almost secret one that a lot of developers don&#39;t even know exists.

This essay is part of a series on offensive horticulture . It&#39;s weird how everybody suddenly forgot about Henry George : He inspired the economic philosophy known as Georgism , the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves, but that the economic value of land (including natural resources) should belong equally to all members of society. George famously argued that a single tax on land values would create a more productive and just society. The US is big. So Ron fought back.

Warning: this is a post about very boring yakshaving, probably only of interest to people who are trying to upgrade Hugo from a very old version to a new version. But what are blogs for if not documenting one’s very boring yakshaves from time to time? So yesterday I decided to try to upgrade Hugo. There’s no real reason to do this – I’ve been using Hugo version 0.40 to generate this blog since 2018, it works fine, and I don’t have any problems with it. I upgraded from Hugo v0.135 (from 2024).57.

The parents of a 19-year-old Connecticut honors student accused of taking part in a $243 million cryptocurrency heist in August were carjacked a week later, while out house-hunting in a brand new Lamborghini. Prosecutors say the couple was beaten and briefly kidnapped by six young men who traveled from Florida as part of a botched plan to hold the parents for ransom.

Many things can make software more challenging to understand and, consequently, to maintain. One of the most complex and problematic causes is managing internal mutable states. When the internal state is poorly managed, the software behaves unexpectedly, leading to bugs and fixing, which introduces unnecessary complexity. FP solves this problem by providing immutability mechanisms and more. By Uberto Barbini

## [Key Prometheus concepts every Grafana user should know](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/10/11/key-prometheus-concepts-every-grafana-user-should-know/)


Prometheus has become an essential technology in the world of monitoring and observability. I’ve been aware of its importance for some time, but as a performance engineer, my experience with Prometheus had been limited to using it to store some metrics and visualize them in Grafana. Being a Grafanista, I felt I should dig deeper into Prometheus, knowing it had much more to offer than just being a place to throw performance test results. Prometheus provides several ways to do this. Push vs. pull.

Over the summer we told you about an update to our core Prometheus data source , which was part of a larger shift in our effort to meet users where they are. It’s a change we’re really excited about, as it represents our biggest step yet toward enabling the creation of truly vendor-neutral data sources for Grafana. At the same time, we kept both data sources working by building the libraries they could consume.g. &lt;img src=&#34;/media/blog/prometheus-data-source/prometheus-data-source-diagram.

## [Inside PromQL: A closer look at the mechanics of a Prometheus query](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/10/08/inside-promql-a-closer-look-at-the-mechanics-of-a-prometheus-query/)


Even though I’m a Prometheus maintainer and work inside the Prometheus code, I found many of the details of PromQL, the Prometheus query language, obscure. Many times I would look something up, or go deep into the code to find out exactly what it did, only to forget it again the next month.” In this blog post, I recap and expand on some of the main points I touched on during that talk. Note: This is a description of PromQL implementation as of the Prometheus 2.54 release and 3.0 beta release.g..

In the observability space, ease-of-use has always been a key differentiator for Grafana. As much as we want to offer a powerful observability platform to our users, we also want to ensure they can get up and running as quickly as possible. Still, for those of you sitting down to build your first dashboard, we totally understand that a little guidance can go a long way. Add a data source Grafana comes with support for many built-in support data sources. Click the data source you want to add.

## [DDIA: Chp 7. Transactions (Part 2): Serializability](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/10/ddia-chp-7-transactions-part-2.html)


We are continuing from the first part of our Chapter 7 review .  Serializable isolation ensures that the final result of concurrent transactions is equivalent to if they had been run one at a time, without any concurrency. This eliminates any concurrency anomalies, since it ensures the transactions would behave as they would in a sequential environment. The book discusses how these methods apply to distributed systems in Chapter 9. But the other two points didn&#39;t get addressed much.

## [DDIA: Chp 7. Transactions (Part 1)](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/10/ddia-chp-7-transactions-part-1.html)


Chapter 7 of the Designing Data Intensive Applications (DDIA) book discusses transactions, yay! Transactions in database systems group multiple operations into a logical unit, a box of operations if you will. They simplify error handling and help manage concurrency issues. See Gray-Reuters book introduction and fault-tolerance sections for the motivation on this. Atomicity ensures all operations in a transaction either complete fully or not at all. Things changed. So here is that piece.7.e.&#34;

This is a special milestone: 700th post, after 14 years of blogging here. 700 posts is a lot of blogging. But that comes down to 50 posts per year, which is one post a week, totally doable, right? If I can get another 14 years of blogging at this rate, I will get to 1400. That is more than the EWD documents in terms of the sheer number of posts, not that I am comparing my posts with EWD documents. (BTW, of course I had a blog post about the EWDs. But I don&#39;t do it for the feedback...

The European Space Agency’s Hera spacecraft is en route to assess how NASA’s 2022 DART mission impacted the asteroid Dimorphos. DART smashed into the asteroid at a little over 6 kilometers per second, sending out a cloud of debris and slowing it slightly. Hera’s detailed post-collision survey aims to tell us just how efficient the kinetic impact was. This will inform the design of planetary defense missions, should we need to defend Earth from an asteroid threat. Both use cold gas propulsion.

Steve Blank came of age as an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley in the 1970s, when it was truly about the silicon, and by the 1990s he had founded or worked at four high-tech startups. He eventually drew on this experience to create a model of developing customers inspired by the scientific method; it calls for working up various hypotheses, then testing and iterating on them. There’s been hundreds of iterations on it—but it comes back to hypothesis testing, minimum viable products, et cetera.

I’ve been reviewing robot vacuums for more than a decade , and robot mops for just as long . It’s been astonishing how the technology has evolved, from the original iRobot Roomba bouncing off of walls and furniture to robots that use lidar and vision to map your entire house and intelligently keep it clean. This means that your robot can vacuum your house, empty itself, recharge, and repeat this process until the dock’s dirt bag fills up. The mapping process with the S10 was a bit finicky.
