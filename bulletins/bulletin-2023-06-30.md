Why is a boat a “she?” Why give names like Alexa or Siri to inanimate pieces of software? According to assistant professor of organizational behavior Ashley Martin, ascribing gender to everyday objects helps us to connect with them more deeply. “Gender is this humanizing force that allows people to interact with non-human things as if they’re human,” says  Martin , whose research focuses on gender equality, gender inclusion, and gender’s role within team and organizational dynamics.

Alloy is a formal specification language I use a lot. In Alloy, ≈all data is either an atom or a relation between atoms. sig DataSource {} sig Step { requires: set Step } Unlike most languages, Alloy has two notions of subtyping: a type (or “signature”) can be extend ed, which is exclusive, or they can be in , which are stackable . In this example, the source can be generic, a database, or a file, but not all three. Like “all X have at most two dependencies, all Y have at least three.

## [Solving &#34;Two Sum&#34; in C with a tiny hash table](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/06/26/)


I came across a question: How does one efficiently solve Two Sum in C? There’s a naive quadratic time solution, but also an amortized linear time solution using a hash table. Without a built-in or standard library hash table, the latter sounds onerous. However, a mask-step-index table , a hash table construction suitable for many problems, requires only a few lines of code. In particular, the solution doesn’t find elements, but their indices. With nested loops, it’s obviously quadratic time.....

Kubernetes security needs a deeper understanding of the ecosystem and strategies to secure it at different levels, like nodes, pods, and data. Red Hat reports that 94% of DevOps engineers faced at least one Kubernetes security issue in 2022.

For the last several years, internal infrastructure at LinkedIn has been built around a self-service model, enabling developers to onboard themselves with minimal support. We have various user experiences that let application teams provision their own resources and infrastructure, generally by filling out forms or using command-line tools. For example, developers can provision Kafka topics, Espresso tables, Venice stores and more via Nuage, our internal cloud-like infra management platform.

Posted by Fabian Pedregosa and Eleni Triantafillou, Research Scientists, Google Deep learning has recently driven tremendous progress in a wide array of applications, ranging from realistic image generation and impressive retrieval systems to language models that can hold human-like conversations . This can raise privacy concerns, as it implies that even if an individual&#39;s data is deleted from a database, it may still be possible to infer whether that individual&#39;s data was used to train a model.

## [Back to America](https://world.hey.com/dhh/back-to-america-7e878fa2)


After spending much of the past three years in Denmark, our family is returning to America full time this summer. The original reasons for temporarily emigrating – the prolonged school lockdowns and other pandemic madness – have long since evaporated, and we&#39;ve had a solid chance to taste all that Copenhagen has to offer. And that&#39;s a lot. This is a wonderful country and a wonderful capital. But life isn&#39;t just a set of rational arguments for or against. How could it not.

There hasn&#39;t been a major, dedicated Rails conference in Europe since 2008, so perhaps it&#39;s no surprise that there was pent-up demand. But I was still shocked to see the forthcoming Rails World visit to Amsterdam sell out in less than 45 minutes yesterday! What an awesome reception to the first major project undertaken by our new Rails Foundation . Same too for our contributing members, like AppSignal , Cedarcode and Planet Argon . Especially because this feels like just the beginning.

Since it took us years to get into the cloud in the first place, I originally imagined it would take us years to get out as well. But all that work to containerize our applications and prepare them for the cloud actually turned out to make it relatively easy to exit. And now, after six months of effort, it&#39;s done. We&#39;re out. The last application was brought home to our own hardware on Wednesday. But the big move was HEY . This is an application that was born in the cloud. Look at it this way.
