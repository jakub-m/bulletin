Introduction A blockchain is an integrated solution of different computer science problems in the form of a single, append-only, publicly available, transparent, and cryptographically auditable database that runs in a distributed and decentralized environment. I’ve heard many times that blockchain is a technology looking for a problem to solve. I disagree with that assessment because the tech and computer science behind blockchain has practical uses in everyday engineering problems.

Some are specific web pages that act as a canary, alerting me before an attacker ramps up. Some appear as online services. These watch for when attackers scan for new vulnerabilities in existing services. And some are entire fake domains, waiting to see what new comes in. One of my fake domains hosts a web site.

Nowadays, technical debt can be considered the bread and butter of most IT-powered enterprises around the world. Almost every company that survived the startup phase and managed to deliver its first products to customers will face at some point technical challenges related to past architectural decisions. Although code engineering gets better every year, we cannot argue with the obvious fact of life: the market will always force many of us to deliver tech products faster than we wish.g.mckinsey.

If you’re using macOS at work, however, your team might not be able to roll out Tailscale to your entire organization if not everyone has an Apple ID. In this case, it’s common to use a mobile device management (MDM) solution that allows you to distribute applications that are not available in the App Store. Starting with Tailscale v1.

Back in 2011, Rob Pike gave a talk on the topic of Lexical Scanning in Go , where he presented an interesting approach to lexical analysis with coroutines (implemented via goroutines communicating over a channel). Since I&#39;ve been pondering the connection between coroutines and state machines in the past, Rob&#39;s talk inspired me to try approximating this approach in Python using sub-generators . There&#39;s something in this approach that feels elegant - it&#39;s a problem very well suited for coroutines.

Instead of every part of a model processing every input (“dense” modeling), sparse models employing conditional computation learn to route individual inputs to different “experts” in a potentially huge network.

Automating software delivery is a critical priority for any organization that follows the DevOps paradigm. Successful implementation of a CI/CD pipeline largely hinges on automating several manual tasks that are labor-intensive. To that end, scripts, plugins, and other tools help standardize various production and deployment processes and more importantly, eliminate the possibility of human error in the pipeline. But we can offer a solution in the form of GitOps. 1. 2. 3. 4.

Despite these strengths, there are certain pre-deployment checks that would benefit any GitOps practice. That is the focus of this post. 1.

## [Graph Data Science on Google Cloud: Neo4j AuraDS and Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/neo4j-aurads-and-google-cloud-vertex-ai/)


In January, we previewed Neo4j’s and Google Cloud Vertex AI’s partnership in a blog about how you can use graphs for smarter AI when using Neo4j AuraDS to generate graph embeddings. This blog post garnered a lot of attention from data scientists looking to amplify their machine learning (ML) pipelines by feeding knowledge (graph features) of the graph to enhance the ML model&#39;s predictability. Since then, Neo4j released a new 2.0 version of the Neo4j Graph Data Science Platform.TabularDataset.

## [Infrastructure Security in Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/infrastructure-security-in-google-cloud/)


The security of the infrastructure that runs your applications is one of the most important considerations in choosing a cloud vendor. Google Cloud’s approach to infrastructure security is unique. Google doesn’t rely on any single technology to secure its infrastructure. Rather, it has built security through progressive layers that deliver defense in depth. They are monitored 24/7 by high-resolution cameras that can detect and track intruders.   For more #GCPSketchnote, follow the GitHub repo .

Here’s your sign. Customers and employees want to be delighted, and delivering those experiences is key. You may be wondering how to create these premium experiences, and you may have even tried to no avail in the past. Deploying kiosks and digital signage are two ways to help users with information, transactions, and more, but the route to delight hasn’t been so straightforward. Many solutions create more IT overhead, increase security risks, and are prone to instability.

Many people are again crowding store aisles as they look for their favorite products and eagerly try on clothing, shoes, and jewelry. Although some shoppers purchase multiple items, others leave the store empty handed. As retailers know, there are many possible reasons why some people only window shop. Perhaps a favorite item is too expensive, out of stock, or too hard to find in the store. That’s why we built Palexy . We’re also seeing Tau VMs reduce video decoding costs by up to 40%.

Records are made to be broken. In 2019, we calculated 31.4 trillion digits of π — a world record at the time. Then, in 2021, scientists at the University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons calculated another 31.4 trillion digits of the constant, bringing the total up to 62.8 trillion decimal places. Today we&#39;re announcing yet another record: 100 trillion digits of π.  This achievement is a testament to how much faster Google Cloud infrastructure gets, year in, year out.  Program : y-cruncher v0.

We’ve recently supported an organization who wanted to expose its Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) backend behind Apigee X . A quite common architecture, which most of the users delivering modern web applications on Google Cloud tend to build upon. In this scenario, Google’s API gateway, Apigee , receives requests and performs L7 routing, redirecting you to the correct backend application, running as one or more pods on GKE. This may increase latency and add management overhead... Read Article

We recently received helpful information through the Vulnerability Rewards Program for Authorized Networks and Cloud Run/Functions on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Based on that information, we updated our product documentation and prioritized a plan to make engineering changes to GKE to restrict access to only GKE-related services. Our existing firewall rules allow the Kubernetes API server’s IP address to be reachable from the Cloud Run and Cloud Functions services.
