Kubernetes Adoption Grows Across Multiple Environments Kubernetes adoption continues to expand, with 64% of organizations using it in production and 25% either piloting or evaluating it. As the de facto method for running containers at scale in production, Kubernetes is now being used by many prominent global enterprises to run their business applications in production. Furthermore, more than a third (35%) are using Kubernetes for Edge environments.

I managed the engineering team at Digg as we ran out of money, and were eventually acquired . It was an eye opening experience, and I learned a great deal about the reality and the optics of selling a company, particularly one with no money and a shrinking user base. Humbling was just the beginning. Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to evaluate a number of companies from the other side of the Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) table. Documenting your acquisition thesis is extremely valuable.g.g.

Ever since I switched this website to a static setup in 2014, I&#39;ve been trying to simplify it even more. In 2018 I turned off Disqus comments , eliminating a large source of latency. Recently, an additional effort to reduce dependencies and be more self-contained led to the replacement of Google Analytics by a self-hosted OSS analytics solution. Overall, the process of setting this up didn&#39;t seem sufficiently simple to me - but I may have well overlooked something. OSS and written in Go .4.4.0..

Here I’ll describe something a bit lighter: world building, or specifically city building, with GPT . This post is for people who are interested in building interactive tools on top of GPT and want to see some of the things I’ve encountered and what I’ve found that is successful and what is still a challenge.g.g.

## [ Speedy Transactions in Multicore In-Memory Databases](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2023/02/speedy-transactions-in-multicore-in.html)


This paper is from SOSP&#39;13. The Polyjuice paper, which we studied last week, built on the Silo codebase and commit protocol, which led me to read the Silo paper. Silo is a single-node multi-core in-memory database. It avoids all centralized contention points, including centralized transaction ID (TID) assignment. Logging and recovery is provided by linking periodically-updated epochs with the commit protocol. That is pretty impressive over 2013 hardware. That is also impressive.2.0.

In large organizations, culture is key. The values and habits of an organization, and what it rewards and punishes, are the background radiation driving towards discrete outcomes in a world of infinite possibility. Your culture is a living thing - it changes and adapts to new teammates, external forces, and the broader environment. And sometimes it gets sick; sometimes your culture gets a virus. Below we’ll work through examples of common culture viruses that can occur as companies grow..etc. E.

Half a year after the LastPass breach started in August 2022, information on it remains sparse. It took until December 2022 for LastPass to admit losing their users’ partially encrypted vault data. This statement was highly misleading , e.g. making wrong claims about the protection level provided by the encryption. Despite many questions being raised, LastPass maintained strict radio silence since December. Until yesterday they published an article with details of the breach .g.

Introduction In episode 4, Miki defined an enumerated type that satisfied Go’s fmt.Stringer interface. By implementing the fmt.Stringer interface, Miki can specify how his enumerators were printed within a formatted string and in this case, he expected the values to be displayed as a predetermined text value. Miki also pointed out how using the value of the method’s receiver within the Stringer method can result in a recursive loop.

## [Day Two Cloud 184: Think Multiplatform, Not Multicloud](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/day-two-cloud-184-think-multiplatform-not-multicloud/)


Today on Day Two Cloud we put on our thinking caps about platforms, cloud, and multicloud. The last ten years or so has been a push for &#34;cloud-first,&#34; but any wholesale approach to &#34;X-first&#34; (cloud, edge, digital, etc.) is problematic. We discuss why. We also explore strategies for CTOs, IT managers, and engineers on how to grapple with cloud strategy, implementation, and operation. The post Day Two Cloud 184: Think Multiplatform, Not Multicloud appeared first on Packet Pushers .

## [Tech Bytes: ThousandEyes Enhances Data Correlation With OpenTelemetry (Sponsored)](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/tech-bytes-thousandeyes-enhances-data-correlation-with-opentelemetry-sponsored/)


Today on the Tech Bytes podcast we’re talking about OpenTelemetry with sponsor Cisco ThousandEyes. OpenTelemetry is an open collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs to help share telemetry data among different monitoring and analysis platforms to improve data correlation and visibility. ThousandEyes, the first network visibility platform to support OpenTelemetry, joins the podcast to discuss how it works, use cases, and more.

Is the private 5G market big enough to justify HPE&#39;s acquisition of Athonet? Is saving money worth retreating from public cloud? Why are organizations still getting bit by basic cloud misconfigurations? Will an appetite for AI deliver results for Nvidia? We explore these and other questions in the latest Network Break podcast.

In today’s Heavy Networking show with sponsor Broadcom we go deep into network management and Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM). At its heart, DEM is about understanding the user experience of the network. Network monitoring and management products that incorporate user experience, such as Broadcom&#39;s DX NetOps, can provide visibility into network and application performance to help inform troubleshooting efforts and speed resolution.

Photo by Isaac Smith on  Unsplash Once your model is deployed, monitoring its performance plays a crucial role in ensuring the quality of your ML system. To calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or f1-score, labels are required. However, in many cases, labels can be unavailable, partially available or come in a delayed fashion. In those cases, the ability to estimate the model’s performance can be helpful. a.g. if the score is 0. b. This is known as covariate shift .
