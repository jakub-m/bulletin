Edit (2023-01-04): A Korean translation of this article is now available here , thanks to Woojin Kim. Last September I started investigating a South Korean application with unusually high user numbers. It took me a while to even figure out what it really did, there being close to zero documentation. I eventually realized that the application is riddled with security issues and, despite being advertised as a security application, makes the issue it is supposed to address far, far worse.

Can AI Image generation tools make re-imagined, higher-resolution versions of old video game graphics? Over the last few days, I used AI image generation to reproduce one of my childhood nightmares. I wrestled with Stable Diffusion, Dall-E and Midjourney to see how these commercial AI generation tools can help retell an old visual story - the intro cinematic to an old video game ( Nemesis 2 on the MSX ).

It&#39;s tempting to think you&#39;re doing someone new a favor by initially holding them to lower standards on work, effort, or decision making. They&#39;re new! They need to find their feet! Yes and yes, but neither fact is helped by going easy on what good decisions, reasonable effort, and solid work needs to look like at your company. Now keeping the bar high for all isn&#39;t the same as expecting that everyone is going to meet it right away. Nobody hits the ground running . Don&#39;t.

This permits me to walk while watching some streaming shows. I can honestly say that I&#39;ve seen every good piece of science fiction on Netflix. (As well as some really bad sci-fi.) When I started running low on new content, I began rewatching the good shows. (I must have seen The Old Guard at least a half dozen times. SSL, TLS 1.2 and 1.

## [Two surprises in browser crashes](https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2023/01/browser-crashes.html)


You might be surprised, as I was, to learn that Chrome exposes an API to notify you when the browser crashes on your page. It is part of a larger reporting API that is designed to give browsers a channel to inform you, the developer, of crashes and other things. In particular for a page crash you no longer have a page or JS context to receive the event, so the API instead POSTs some JSON to a URL you provide. The discrepancy turned out to be caused by a misconfiguration.

In my stint on Twitter, I heard about “e/acc”. It stands for effective accelerationism, and seems largely to be a way to mock Effective Altruists, the Catholic to the Protestant EAs (or reverse that?). Like most quasi-right “ideologies”, it is not taken seriously by its adherents. Only the left takes ideology seriously. Nobody is blocking highways for accelerationism. But perhaps they should be, acceleration is the greatest form of charity. And we know what happens to conservatives.

## [Microfeatures I&#39;d like to see in more languages](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/microfeatures-id-like-to-see-in-more-languages/)


There are roughly three classes of language features: Features that the language is effectively designed around, such that you can’t add it after the fact. Laziness in Haskell, the borrow checker in Rust, etc. Features that heavily define how to use the language. Adding these are possible later, but would take a lot of design, engineering, and planning. I’d say pattern matching, algebraic data types, and async fall under here. The first is adding a separator, as lots of languages already do.5 ..

Happy new year everyone! There’s gonna be some changes to the newsletter this year, see after the article for details. But first, let’s talk formal methods. I normally sell TLA&#43; based on the model checker: you give it a design and it tells you if the design has flaws. When other FM experts try to sell TLA&#43;, they focus on the mental benefits of modeling: just the act of writing the model itself helps you find bugs. It’s a skill you pick up over time. Even so, I center the model checker in FM.  ↩

Most systems today rely on Unicode strings. However, we have two popular Unicode formats: UTF-8 and UTF-16. We often need to convert from one format to the other. For example, you might have a database formatted with UTF-16, but you need to produce JSON documents using UTF-8. This conversion is often called ‘transcoding’.

Introduction In episode 11, Bill highlighted the issue of identity verification and provided a solution to this problem. The solution proposed was to cryptographically sign a transaction to verify its authenticity. Bill chose to implement a solution making use of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) as the public key can be extracted from a signature.

Introduction In episode 9, Bill introduced the idea of the genesis record and its role in his blockchain. As a recap, the genesis record will be used to customize the settings of his blockchain. The approach Bill takes here is similar to how Ethereum operates because he is storing the record in JSON format. In this video, Bill starts by defining the Go types his blockchain will use. The first type he defines will represent the genesis record.

While doing so, he provided an in-depth look at the reasoning behind the fields he included.. After declaring this type, Bill wrote a function that loads the genesis record from disk and onto memory. His function will use the standard library encoding/json package to load JSON data from a hard-coded file path.

There are many important meetings in your first ninety days as a new engineering leader, but one that’s both easy to forget and surprisingly important is your first meeting with the finance team. Generally, the finance team’s auditors won’t certify their annual financial audits unless they’ve followed GAAP, part of which is deciding whether to capitalize or expense each incurred cost. That said, most finance teams are much more focused on GAAP compliance than on maximizing capitalization.

Let&#39;s just go through the steps for getting a secure web site going, and ignore the specifics of the protocol for the moment. First, the baseline assumptions: there&#39;s a key. There&#39;s a certificate signing request which references that key.

It looks like it was created by people who had been drinking FAR too much of the web kool-aid, since it&#39;s chock full of terrible things. It should be a small amount of drama to start a process, receive a magic string, sock it away somewhere at a magic path, then poke the validator and say &#34;go for it&#34;. Then you just check back and see whether it worked or not.

Just a hair over 10 years ago, I wrote a post lamenting the fact that my WiFi-only original iPad (which was new at the time) was probably a mistake. After all, if I took it outside my house and away from the one wireless network it knew, it was now cut off from the Internet. If someone stole it or if I left it behind somewhere, there would be no way to track it down or wipe it. Well, times change, and now that&#39;s no longer a concern. Yeah, that was a pretty bad call.

CMake is an open source multiplatform tool that you can use to help with build automation, testing, packaging, and the installation of software. One of the main advantages of CMake is that it supports generating build scripts for a wide variety of platforms including Windows , macOS, and Linux. This gives developers the flexibility they need when building a new project and hopefully helps speed up the build. In this article, you’ll learn more about CMake and if it’s the right solution for you.

Training ML models can be computationally expensive. If you’re training models on large datasets, you might be used to model training taking hours, or days, or even weeks. But it’s not just a large volume of data that can increase training time. Nonoptimal implementations such as an inefficient input pipeline or low GPU usage can dramatically increase your training time. Making sure your programs are running efficiently and without bottlenecks is key to faster training.cloud.aiplatform.init()...
