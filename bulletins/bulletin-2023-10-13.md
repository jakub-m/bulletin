Offices closed, we stopped traveling, and we had to change the way we interacted with others. In the face of this disaster, businesses were challenged to adapt to continue operating while keeping their employees safe and healthy.

A few conversations last week made me realize I use the word “interesting” in an unusual way. I rely heavily on mental models. Of course, everyone relies on mental models. But I do it intentionally and I push it extra hard. What I mean by that is, when I’m making predictions about what will happen next, I mostly don’t look around me and make a judgement based on my immediate surroundings. If this sounds predictably error prone: yes. It is. Here’s my system. But you can try to compensate for it.

The world ain’t fair. Well, it depends on how you define fair. One thing is certainly true - companies cannot provide the same opportunity to every employee. Each position in a company has a unique set of opportunities, for example: Some teams have a stronger support ecosystem than others Some managers are stronger than others. You might get an all star or you might get a mortal. Some teams are overfunded; some are underfunded. Some people get teed-up grand slam projects and some people don’t.e.

## [(People on) Nice Teams Finish Last](https://staysaasy.com/leadership/2023/10/06/ambiguity.html)


One of the most common management mistakes is not providing clarity when people are wrong on important, invested efforts. For example, say you’re an IC engineer and you want to propose moving our Critical Service from python to Go for speed improvements. When you get to architecture review, you get feedback that we can’t do that because Critical Service doesn’t need to be super fast and porting it isn’t a priority - the risk incurred is not worth the return on investment. Soften feedback.e.

For the first time since the 2000s , I&#39;m working on a new Rails application without using any form of real build steps on the front-end. We&#39;re making it using vanilla ES6 with import maps for Hotwire , and vanilla CSS with nesting and variables for styling. All running on a delightfully new simple asset pipeline called Propshaft . It&#39;s all just so... simple. It&#39;s also fast. Really fast. Infinitely fast. Rails 7. These are great tools, and I&#39;m thrilled they work so well with Rails.

Celebrating twenty years of Ruby on Rails with more than 700 happy developers packed into the coolest conference venue possible in Amsterdam was epic. Safe to say, Rails World was a roaring success. Which is deeply satisfying to conclude, because it really wasn&#39;t a given outcome when I started working on The Rails Foundation last year. It&#39;s hard to know how new institutions are going to be received. The internet is often a poor guide for what people really think or what they really want. Really.

User containment is a unique and innovative defense mechanism that stops human-operated attacks in their tracks. We’ve added user containment to the automatic attack disruption capability in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. User containment is automatically triggered by high-fidelity signals and limits attackers’ ability to move laterally within a network regardless of the compromised account’s Active Directory state or privilege level.

Dutch parliament had earlier passed two motions calling on the Dutch government not to support this proposal, but our government has declared it will ignore those motions. This hearing was timely because next week, or even this Friday, EU member states vote on how to proceed with this terrible proposal (Lawfare review from a US perspective).
