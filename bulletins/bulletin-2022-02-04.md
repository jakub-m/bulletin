So I love academia, and I also built two businesses. When I dropped out of studying physics to focus on my company, I assumed I knew everything, since I had studied physics! Turned out that if you enter the world of commerce, it is very bad if you are visibly confused about the difference between business development and sales. It does nothing for your credibility.

## [ACL tags are generally available](https://tailscale.com/blog/acl-tags-ga/)


ACL tags can be applied to a Tailscale device in order to manage access permissions based on its tag. Tailscale already allows you to manage access to devices based on their names, rather than IP addresses; and tags take this a step further, so you can manage access to devices based on their purpose. And we’ve further locked down ACL tags, so that authentication is required when re-tagging a device. ACL tags are a free feature, available in all pricing tiers. Then, tag the devices.

For some reason, though, people seem to hate them. And those “some reasons” are They’re very hard to read, so you have no idea what a given regex you see does . They’re fragile, so slight changes to the input can break your regex. Making them more robust also makes problem (1) worse.) I’m updating learntla this year...  ↩

Traits are a central feature of Rust, critical for its implementation of polymorphism; traits are used for both static (by serving as bounds for generic parameters) and dynamic (by having trait objects to serve as interfaces) polymorphism. This post assumes some familiarity with traits and discusses only a specific aspect of them - how extension traits affect code readability. To learn the basics of traits in Rust, the official book is a good starting point. name .g... unwrap (); wv ... nothing.

Disclaimer: Sometime around a 2015, I wrote AWS&#39;s official internal guidance on balancing deployment speed and safety. This blog post is not that. It&#39;s not official guidance from AWS (nothing on this blog is), and certainly not guidance for AWS. Instead, it&#39;s my own take on deployments and safety, and how I think about the space. It&#39;s what I like to see too. The second is less obvious.95%.

MySQL is one of the most popular SQL-compatible relational databases. Running MySQL inside a Docker container lets you separate your database from your code.

## [A toy DNS resolver](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/02/01/a-dns-resolver-in-80-lines-of-go/)


Hello! I wrote a comic last week called “life of a DNS query” that explains how DNS resolvers work. In this post, I want to explain how DNS resolvers work in a different way – with a short Go program that does the same thing described in the comic. The main function ( resolve ) is actually just 20 lines, including comments. The program is here: https://github.com/jvns/tiny-resolver/blob/main/resolve.go what’s a DNS resolver? When your browser needs to make a DNS query, it asks a DNS resolvers ..

## [Reasons for servers to support IPv6](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/01/29/reasons-for-servers-to-support-ipv6/)


I’ve been having a hard time understanding IPv6. On one hand, the basics initially seem pretty straightforward (there aren’t enough IPv4 addresses for all the devices on the internet, so people invented IPv6! There are enough IPv6 addresses for everyone!) But when I try to actually understand it, I run into a lot of questions. One question is: twitter.com does not support IPv6. Presumably it can’t be causing them THAT many issues to not support it. how can you tell twitter.com and stripe.com.

Stop exaggerating. It doesn’t help your argument, it degrades your integrity. People often exaggerate because they feel they don’t have the time or evidence to win an argument.”

Nothing beats the security and operational flexibility of using certificate-based authentication for a large fleet of SSH servers running on dynamic infrastructure. But in practice, certificate-based authentication is far from the de facto authentication method, and sometimes we may need to use SSH keys. So it helps to learn the best way to generate and use SSH keys. Give it a try ...
