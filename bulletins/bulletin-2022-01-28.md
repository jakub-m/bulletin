Most of applications we create are basically loops. An average program waits for an event, then processes it following some business logic. Afterwards it begins waiting for another event to arrive. Java Servlets work this way too. Popular frameworks such as Spring allow us to only care about the business logic, while the framework takes care of the application main loop. The problem with blocking operations Imagine a very simple web application whose task is to calculate currency exchange rates.

Remember when systems would go offline to implement changes and updates? Sometimes you still get emails from applications with notifications of downtime, apologizing in advance for any interruption. That’s a costly and outdated way of maintaining applications that are constantly evolving. These days, blue/green deployments address the downtime and embarrassing errors that are commonly associated with taking an application offline for updates. The cost of two production environments.

In the futuristic society of year 6000-something, people no longer need to learn their profession from books, lectures or hands-on experience. The folks who end up the best at their craft (determined via competitions) end up with high-demand assignments on &#34;Class A&#34; outer worlds. Ad infinitum, or at least until Singularity .

Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about putting my static sites on servers that I run myself instead of using managed services like Netlify or GitHub Pages. Originally I thought that running my own servers would require a lot of maintenance and be a huge pain, but I was chatting with Wesley about what kind of maintainance their servers require, and they convinced me that it might not be that bad. So I decided to try out moving all my static sites to a $5/month server to see what it was like.40.

## [Hybrid Logical Clocks](https://sookocheff.com/post/time/hybrid-logical-clocks/)


The theory of distributed systems promoted the use of logical clocks by introducing the idea of causality tracking as an abstraction for reasoning about concurrency between events in the system. In practice, a lot of systems continue to operate using physical time, which presents difficulties due to clock synchronization drift. In an effort to bridge the gap between physical and logical time, HybridTime combines both logical and physical times in one system.

While the tooling is impressive, it’s the principles behind it that captivated Gerhard’s imagination. Vincent has a rather interesting take on the monorepository idea, including one change - one version - one deploy.

Posted by Matt McEwen, Student Researcher, Google Quantum AI and Lara Faoro, Research Fellow, LPTHE- Sorbonne Université and CNRS (Paris) Quantum processors are made of superconducting quantum bits ( qubits ) that — being quantum objects — are highly susceptible to even tiny amounts of environmental noise. This noise can cause errors in quantum computation that need to be addressed to continue advancing quantum computers. However, the world is full of high-energy radiation.g.

Posted by Tom Denton, Software Engineer and Scott Wisdom, Research Scientist, Google Research Birds are all around us, and just by listening, we can learn many things about our environment. Ecologists use birds to understand food systems and forest health — for example, if there are more woodpeckers in a forest, that means there’s a lot of dead wood. Because birds communicate and mark territory with songs and calls, it’s most efficient to identify them by ear.5 dB vs 4.4 dB).

Then we can project any point in the world onto the image using this matrix. We’ll see how to perform camera calibration in this article. ipympl: This is a game-changer.
