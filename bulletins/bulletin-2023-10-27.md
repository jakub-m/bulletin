## [ES Module imports in Node.js and the browser](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/es-module-imports-in-nodejs-and-the-browser/)


For a recent project , I wanted to have some JS code (in multiple files) available for testing from the command-line with Node.js, but also to be able to load the same code into a web page to be invoked directly from a browser. I&#39;ve encountered this same issue before for my in-browser 8080 assembler and simulator project , and used a combination of CommonJS require s with a bundler tool to make it work. But we&#39;re in 2023 now, and CommonJS is supposed to be phasing out. Let&#39;s see how it works....

## [Using Hugo as a redirect service](https://dannorth.net/hugo-redirects/)


I have been building my website with Hugo since early 2021. I love the control it gives me. I recently wanted to start using short URLs in presentations, that would link to either a longer URL on the website or to somewhere else altogether. It turns out Hugo makes this easy but not entirely obvious, so I thought I would write it up.

## [Throwing Shade](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1007-Throwing-Shade.html)


As part of FotoForensics, I try to track major occasions, such as holidays, weather warnings, and astronomical events. Often, I&#39;ll see fake photos of the occasion before it happens. I might see photos of a major blizzard burying a neighborhood days before the storm hits or a beautiful picture of a full moon a week before the full moon. What I&#39;m usually seeing are forgers creating their pictures before the event happens. Similarly, I often see fakes appear shortly after a major event.g.

This was about buying from Tom Rossi , the technical cofounder of HigherPixels (who make Buzzsprout), and his team, because we&#39;d just prefer to do business with them. I&#39;ve known Tom from the Rails community for years, but at Rails World a few weeks ago, I really got to know him better. He reached out.

Let’s jump in. DORA fills this void by introducing stringent rules that institutions must follow.

TLA&#43; excels in providing rapid feedback on your modeling and designs, which facilitates this learning process significantly.

Open source was originally coined to be palatable to corporations, so we should write Free software instead. The web was originally for sharing text documents, so we shouldn&#39;t use it to run apps.
