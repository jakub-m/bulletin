Over the years, I’ve developed a set of “plays”, some go-to tactics for increasing the diversity of my hiring pipeline. This is that playbook.

## [The checklist manifesto (Dr. Atul Gawande, 2009)](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/01/the-checklist-manifesto-dr-atul-gawande.html)


This book advocates for integrating checklists as potent safety and fault-tolerance tools across diverse domains. Atul Gawande, a prominent surgeon, enriches the narrative with numerous surgery cases to emphasize the effectiveness of checklists in handling intricate tasks. The surgery cases are graphic. The unemotional, matter-of-fact tone of the audiobook paradoxically intensified the emotional impact for me. The graphic details effectively drive home the point. Instead, be humble, be smart.

&#34;Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century&#34; by Jessica Bruder - describes the lives of the modern van-dwellers, mostly of older adults that travel around the country between seasonal jobs and live in their RVs or cars. Interesting book that tells a good story and avoids being preachy most of the time. &#34;Oxygen: The molecule that made the world&#34; by Nick Lane - one of Lane&#39;s earliest books.

I&#39;m fairly sure that Excel is the most common way to store data, manipulate data, and yes(!), even pass data around. This is why it&#39;s not uncommon to find yourself reading Excel in Python. In this article I compare several ways to read Excel from Python.

## [Interesting double-poly latches inside AMD&#39;s vintage LANCE Ethernet chip](http://www.righto.com/2023/12/amd-lance-ethernet-double-poly.html)


I&#39;ve studied a lot of chips from the 1970s and 1980s, so I usually know what to expect. But an Ethernet chip from 1982 had something new: a strange layer of yellow wiring on the die. After some study, I learned that the yellow wiring is a second layer of resistive polysilicon, used in the chip&#39;s static storage cells and latches. A closeup of the die of the LANCE chip. The metal has been removed to show the layers underneath. So far, the components of the chip match most NMOS chips of that time.

Five days before Christmas I committed my patch to add incremental backup to PostgreSQL.

Since then, there&#39;s been a bunch of bug-fix commits, and there are still a few pending items that need to be addressed, but the core of the feature is now committed. If you want a quick overview of the feature, Lukas Fittl has a great video about that . Read more »

I had many negative misconceptions about sales teams before working in SaaS. After years as an engineer and product manager, high-skills sales reps are one of the groups whom I respect the most. This is what I wish that someone had told me about sales before I began working in tech – an introduction to the person selling your product. The person selling your product matters. The person selling your product is not an optional add-on, or a glorified landing page who exists just to give demos.g.

In this article I&#39;ll show you how I did it.

It’s an infectious belief, and a necessary one to write a concise, coherent narrative story about the origins of Silicon Valley. That said, I do think that there are non-obvious ways that seemingly mediocre executives outperform the sum of their capabilities, and seemingly brilliant executives underperform their talents.

Denmark has long ranked high on the list of societies that American liberals dream about turning the United States into. And for many good reasons. Education is state-funded, and students are even paid a stipend to go to university. Health care is equally free of individual charge, and there’s generally a robust social safety net for unemployment, maternity leave, and the like. There’s a lot to love about Denmark, and I do. These benefits are fenced by a myriad of compromises and obligations.

Programmers at large seem eternally skeptical of style. And I’m not just talking about the stereotype of nerds in uncoordinated outfits or using pocket protectors. But style in the broad sense of aesthetics. Many appear imbued with fundamental opposition to the idea that how something looks should even matter. That somehow such a focus is conflict with where it ought to be: on substance. This is very apparent in the discussion about linting code. That’s the most totalitarian approach.

It’s the one thing that kept them using Gmail or Outlook or whatever. We heard that feedback from the moment we launched HEY, but we didn’t just want to tick a box on a feature chart. If we were going to do a calendar for HEY, it had to be as interesting, inspiring, and innovative as HEY itself. A complete rethink, just like we did for email. Enjoy!

There was scarcely a programming or product topic that couldn’t be turned into a struggle session on account of some perceived transgression or privilege. It was, to use the trauma language of those days, exhausting . It also simply seemed like the new normal, something that was going to be that way forever. Thankfully, it wasn’t. The motivation for certain groups of people to find another place to be.

## [Is Thread Pool Plugin the Right Choice for Your Workload?](https://www.percona.com/blog/is-thread-pool-plugin-the-right-choice-for-your-workload/)


TL&amp;DR: Depending on the workload, the thread pool plugin can cause serious performance drops.This post was motivated by two recent cases I’ve worked with. Two setups running in cluster mode: one in MariaDB&#43;Galera and one with Percona XtraDB Cluster (Percona Server&#43;Galera). In both cases, the clusters had the thread pool plugin enabled and were serving […]

The wafers of silicon that ultimately become the chips in your smartphone consist of a single crystal.

According to research presented last month at the 2023 IEEE International Electron Device Meeting (IEDM), the industry might not be using the best crystal orientation for upcoming devices. Crystals can be reduced to a unit structure that’s infinitely repeatable.
