According to Julia Minson, knowing how these notions differ is crucial to how you approach them.  In this episode of Think Fast Talk Smart , Minson and strategic communication lecturer Matt Abrahams delve into the intricacies of conflict and disagreement. Minson emphasizes the need for genuine curiosity and receptiveness in communication to foster productive dialogue.

&#34;Lessons in Chemistry: A Novel&#34; by Bonnie Garmus - a research chemist finds her way in the world following multiple personal tragedies and facing extreme gender discrimination. I have some mixed feelings about this book. On one hand it&#39;s original, enternaining, well-written and thought provoking. On the other hand it&#39;s full of shallow plot twists and extreme characters tuned all the way to 11. I found it mostly tedious, because all the original concepts were already covered in the earlier books.

Het gesprek vond plaats op het ministerie van Economische Zaken en Klimaat, en deelnemers waren onder andere minister Micky Adriaansens en staatssecretaris van digitalisering Alexandra van Huffelen. Het onderwerp wordt dus (terecht) serieus genomen. Dit artikel is onderdeel van een grotendeels Engelstalige reeks over Europese innovatie en digitale afhankelijkheden.

Thankfully, with the available ML libraries and the OpenAI embedding API, I can use text embeddings and cosine similarity to find related blog posts in a couple of lines of Python. What are those?

## [The Critical Part Of Any Productivity System.](https://www.carlpullein.com/blog/the-critical-part-of-any-productivity-system/3/4/2024)


There are two things all dependable productivity systems have in common. First, they are focused on getting “stuff” into the system quickly and easily. Second, they are focused on processes rather than tools. Collect stuff. The advantage of having a personal productivity system is you become less dependent on your brain to remember things. This means you can externalise whatever is asked of you and then make decisions about what needs to be done and when. Introducing the UCT. Organising. Use it.

Suppose you have some structured data in your Rust WebAssembly program that you want to expose to JavaScript. There are different ways to do it with different tradeoffs, and in this post I dive a bit into them and sketch out a new better way. For a concrete example, in retrowin32&#39;s debugger there&#39;s a disassembly view (click &#39;step&#39; once in that UI to see) that renders some assembly using React. That is not just a glob of plain text, but rather structured data where e.g.g.decode() es it.g.

Two years ago, when we launched Grafana 9, we announced the deprecation of legacy alerting and introduced Grafana Alerting, the new default alerting system in all editions of Grafana.  Since then we have invested in Grafana Alerting, making it easier to create and manage your alerts . Along the way we have also worked to make the transition from legacy alerting to Grafana Alerting as seamless as possible in preparation for the time when we remove legacy alerting altogether from Grafana.

This post, which they wrote together, was originally published on the Prometheus.io blog in March 2024. The OpenTelemetry project is an observability framework and toolkit designed to create and manage telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs.g., supporting both push and pull.47.server.request.duration .

With great power comes great… complexity? When we introduced Grafana Alerting a few years ago, it included a powerful routing feature that teams could use to send alerts to various contact points. Unfortunately, this functionality also came with a fair bit of complexity and an unfamiliar UX. This prevented many users from adopting it, but we’re still big believers in how it can help users. You can use these policies to route alerts to different receivers (email, Slack, Grafana OnCall, etc.

The upper 10 kilometers of the Earth’s crust contains vast geothermal reserves , essentially awaiting human energy consumption to begin to tap into its unstinting power output —which itself yields no greenhouse gasses. And yet, geothermal sources currently produce only three-tenths of one percent of the world’s electricity. Now, an MIT spin-off says it has found a solution in an innovative technology that could dramatically reduce the costs and timelines of drilling to fantastic depths.”
