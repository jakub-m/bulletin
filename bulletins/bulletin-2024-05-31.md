## [The Review Is the Action Item](https://ferd.ca/the-review-is-the-action-item.html)


2024/05/30 The Review Is the Action Item I like to consider running an incident review to be its own action item. Other follow-ups emerging from it are a plus, but the point is to learn from incidents, and the review gives room for that to happen. This is not surprising advice if you’ve read material from the LFI community and related disciplines. However, there are specific perspectives required to make this work, and some assumptions necessary for it, without which things can break down..

## [TLA⁺ Unicode support](https://ahelwer.ca/post/2024-05-28-tla-unicode/)


TLA⁺ was developed by Leslie Lamport, originator of \(\LaTeX\), so it’s unsurprising that TLA⁺ syntax looks pretty \(\LaTeX\)-y. It’s a very mathy language, with much use of symbols like (among others) \A,\E, /\, \/, and \in denoting \(\forall\), \(\exists\), \(\land\), \(\lor\), and \(\in\) respectively. The language tools include a tla2tex command to format TLA⁺ specs into \(\LaTeX\) for integration in research papers.

For over twenty years, the Mac was the default at 37signals . For designers, programmers, support, and everyone else. That mono culture had some clear advantages, like being able to run Kandji and macOS-specific setup scripts. But it certainly also had its disadvantages, like dealing with Apple&#39;s awful reliability years , and being cut off from seeing how half our Basecamp customer base saw by default (since they&#39;re on Windows!). Either way, it&#39;s over. Default doesn&#39;t mean edict, though. Yes/no.

For the last few years, I&#39;ve been fielding a steady flow of questions at FotoForensics from students who want to create AI-based analyzers. Each time, they say they want to use deep-learning to determine if a picture is real or fake. Unfortunately, I tell each of them the same thing: photo analysis is an incredibly difficult topic. Outside of extremely niche uses, there will be little or no accuracy. The main limiting factor is the context. I also included some AI-generated picture.549999952-4..

If a hiker gets lost in the rugged Scottish Highlands, rescue teams sometimes send up a drone to search for clues of the individual’s route—trampled vegetation, dropped clothing, food wrappers. But with vast terrain to cover and limited battery life, picking the right area to search is critical. Traditionally, expert drone pilots use a combination…

Most new applications are built as a single codebase and deployed as a monolith until product-market fit or the need for additional scale is required. Such monolithic applications are easy to write and maintain, and allow you to iterate quickly when there are a smaller number of users and the traffic is low. However, as traffic increases you will need to scale the application to handle the increase in load. One framework for scaling is the “Scale Cube” describe by AKF partners.

Poor data quality can lead to models that fail to generalize well, wasted resources, and delayed (or even failed) projects.

Growing up in the UK in the 1980s, there was a government road safety campaign with the slogan “ Speed kills. ” This campaign aimed to prevent drivers from speeding. The campaign was hard-hitting, which probably was why it has stuck with me. Although TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson’s contrary view: “Speed has never killed anyone. Suddenly becoming stationary, that’s what gets you.” did bring a smile to my face — you can’t argue with that logic. Yet, there are some things where speed is essential.

## [Arenas and the almighty concatenation operator](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2024/05/25/)


I continue to streamline an arena-based paradigm , and stumbled upon a concise technique for dynamic growth — an efficient, generic “concatenate anything to anything” within an arena built atop a core of 9-ish lines of code. The key insight originated from a reader suggestion about dynamic arrays . The subject of concatenation can be a string, dynamic array, or even something else. The “system” is extensible, and especially useful for path handling. data &#43; head . len &#43;= T { a , tail }.......

## [Guidelines for computing sizes and subscripts](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2024/05/24/)


Occasionally we need to compute the size of an object that does not yet exist, or a subscript that may fall out of bounds . It’s easy to miss the edge cases where results overflow, creating a nasty, subtle bug, even in the presence of type safety . Ideally such computations happen in specialized code, such as inside an allocator ( calloc , reallocarray ) and not outside by the allocatee (i.e. malloc ).e. 128-bit integers on 64-bit hosts. Range check before computing a result. No exceptions.e.e..

Grafana dashboards are a great way to combine a lot of technical information into one convenient picture. From time to time, it’s also useful to export data from a particular Grafana visualization to another format, so you can further analyze it and share it with others.  In this blog post, we’ll walk through how to export CSV data for any Grafana visualization you use. This makes it easy to get that data into popular spreadsheet applications, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

As we discussed when we rolled out the latest major release of Grafana Loki , we’ve grown the log aggregation system over the past five years by balancing feature development with supporting users at scale. A big part of the latter has been making queries much faster — and that was a major focus with Loki 3.0 too.  We’ve seen peak query throughput grow from 10 GB/s in our Loki 1.0 days to greater than 1 TB/s even before 3.0.

Large language models, the AI systems that power chatbots like ChatGPT, are getting better and better—but they’re also getting bigger and bigger, demanding more energy and computational power. For LLMs that are cheap, fast, and environmentally friendly, they’ll need to shrink, ideally small enough to run directly on devices like cellphones. Researchers are finding ways to do just that by drastically rounding off the many high-precision numbers that store their memories to equal just 1 or -1.”
