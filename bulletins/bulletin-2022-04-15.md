This blogpost is the result of a research collaboration between the Allegro Machine Learning Research team and the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IMPAN), Warsaw. Introduction Imagine the following scenario: you work in a company as a Research Engineer, and your manager is asking you to design a state-of-the-art algorithm to control a robot arm that should perform a critical task. Then, suppose you have access to the target environment for a limited period of time.e.

You can do many things with computers. Some of them are more productive than others. My recent blog post shows how to authenticate to any service, such as Grafana . Some people took the idea of using Tailscale for authenticating to any service as a neat fact. Others took this as a challenge to come up with even more creative applications of Tailscale for authentication. This is the story of one of the latter cases. Your Minecraft server will show up on your tailnet like any other machine.beta.0.

(Sorry this is late! Dealing with COVID.) I have mild ADHD. I can focus on strenuous mental tasks, but I can’t handle boring or repetitive work. Even something like “manually navigating to a folder” is enough to make procrastinate. I’m always looking for ways to aggressively optimize my workflow. For example, one thing I have to do a lot is type my address into emails and chats and the like. For most people that isn’t a big deal, but for me it’s disruptive. That’s an efficiency gain of 0.org ...

In programming languages like JavaScript or Python, numbers are typically represented using 64-bit IEEE number types (binary64). For these numbers, we have 15 digits of accuracy. It means that you can pick a 15-digit number, such as 1.23456789012345e100 and it can be represented exactly: there exists a floating-point number that has exactly these 15-most significant … Continue reading Floats have 15-digit accuracy in their normal range

Hello! Today I asked on twitter about newer command line tools, like ripgrep and fd and fzf and exa and bat . I got a bunch of replies with tools I hadn’t heard of, so I thought I’d make a list here. A lot of people also pointed at the modern-unix list. You can use xclip to do the same thing on Linux. JSON/YAML/CSV things: jq (a great JSON-wrangling tool) jc (convert various tools’ output into JSON) jo (create JSON objects) yq (like jq , but for YAML).

Simple Simulations for System Builders Even the most basic numerical methods can lead to surprising insights. It&#39;s no secret that I&#39;m a big fan of formal methods. I use P and TLA&#43; often. I like these tools because they provide clear ways to communicate about even the trickiest protocols, and allow us to use computers to reason about the systems we&#39;re designing before we build them 1 . Safety and liveness are crucial properties of systems, but far from being all the properties we care about....

## [Calvin: Fast Distributed Transactions for Partitioned Database Systems](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/04/calvin-fast-distributed-transactions.html)


The Calvin paper appeared in Sigmod 2012. I had read this paper before, and seen it covered in a reading group, but I never got to write a post about it, and I&#39;m remedying that today. I think the name Calvin comes as a pun on the predestination doctrine in Calvinism . Calvin is all about pre-ordering transactions in logs in batches, and then deterministically executing this log in the same order in replicas. System architecture Calvin does full replication. Each replica is a full replica.

By Alex Hutter , Falguni Jhaveri and Senthil Sayeebaba Over the past few years Content Engineering at Netflix has been transitioning many of its services to use a federated GraphQL platform. GraphQL federation enables domain teams to independently build and operate their own Domain Graph Services (DGS) and, at the same time, connect their domain with other domains in a unified GraphQL schema exposed by a federated gateway .).

These behaviors are largely unspoken, but they do exist: there are consequences for violating them. In this series, I aim to write down some of these rules and explore their implications.

Platform teams. Stream-aligned is another term for application development teams. Platform teams, on the other hand, exist to support application development teams and make resources available to them whenever needed. However, this is a new concept that many organizations need to learn before they master.

Compliance, unlike its cousin, cybersecurity, is a contender for the least sexy subject in business. But when it comes to the speed at which you can introduce new software features, getting them both right is critical. Updates to your apps make their way from developers’ keyboards to live production environments via increasingly complex pipelines – and at every stage of these pipelines, security and compliance issues can arise. Implementing automated policies (policy as code) can stop this.

There’s a modern trend for enterprise applications to either be containerized or deployed in virtual machines (VMs). As a result, software engineers must ensure that their local development environments closely resemble the target infrastructure to ensure that code runs smoothly in production. This in turn requires a fleet of consistent development environments to minimize dependency failures and facilitate system testing. Two technologies— Vagrant and Docker —are particularly popular solutions.

Posted by Andreas Steiner and Basil Mustafa, Research Software Engineers at Google Research, Brain team The ability to classify images into categories has been transformed by deep learning. It has also been significantly accelerated by transfer learning , whereby models are first pre-trained on large datasets, like ImageNet , to learn visual representations that are then transferred via fine-tuning to a new task with less data (e.g., classifying animals).g.k.a.4% .

And guess what, the same thing happened now as it did at KubeCon 2015: Sam pointed to Andrea. This one is going to be fun!
