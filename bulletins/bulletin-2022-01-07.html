                                Recently a security hole in a certain open source Java library resulted in a worldwide emergency kerfuffle as, say, 40% of the possibly hundreds of millions of worldwide deployments of this library needed to be updated in a hurry. (The other 60% also needed to be updated in a hurry, but won&#39;t be until they facilitate some ransomware, which is pretty normal for these situations.) I have a 20&#43; year history of poking fun at Java in this space, and it pains me to stop now...&#34; Suddenly, oh, crap...

                                In Superintelligence: The Idea That Eats Smart People , Maciej Pinboard nee Cegłowski talks about analyzing AI risk with the perspective of the “outside view”: Say that some people show up at your front door one day wearing funny robes, asking you if you will join their movement. They believe that a UFO is going to visit Earth two years from now, and it is our task to prepare humanity for the Great Upbeaming. […] The outside view tells you something different. Yes. Yes. Yup. No. Nope.  ↩

                                Even if you’ve used Docker for your smaller or locally developed software, you might find that it can be daunting for more complex tasks. This can especially be true for secrets management and sharing—areas often overlooked when working with containerized applications. There isn’t a standardized approach for accessing and managing secrets in containers, which has resulted in homegrown or inadequate solutions better geared for more static environments.env variables during debugging.25.

                                &#34;Chasing New Horizons: Inside the Epic First Mission to Pluto&#34; by Alan Stern and David Grinspoon - a fascinating account of the New Horizons mission, told by its principal investigator. Lots of interesting scientific and engineering details about the mission. A good portion of the book is spent on NASA politics in the lead-up to the mission approval, which turned out to be surprisingly interesting. Enjoyable book that served well as my yearly don&#39;t-forget-to-read-in-Spanish ritual.

                                Norton 360, one of the most popular antivirus products on the market today, has installed a cryptocurrency mining program on its customers&#39; computers. Norton&#39;s parent firm says the cloud-based service that activates the program and enables customers to profit from the scheme -- in which the company keeps 15 percent of any currencies mined -- is &#34;opt-in,&#34; meaning users have to agree to enable it.

The last value for last year is December 31, 2021 at 23:59, and in this format it becomes 2112312359. That just fits into a signed 32 bit number (which tops out at 2147483647).

                                One of the things that makes DNS difficult to understand is that it’s decentralized . There are thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands? I don’t know!) of authoritative nameservers, and at least 10 million resolvers . And they’re running lots of different software! All these different servers running software means that there’s a lot of inconsistency in how DNS works, which can cause all kinds of frustrating problems. This is very important but it’s not what this post is about.io maps 10.0.0.1.0.

While you may have heard of GitOps, now is a good time to check out opengitops.dev. The most interesting part of today’s conversation is the missing cloud native App Store. While Apple revolutionised the world with the App Store and the iPhone, we don’t yet have something similar for cloud native apps.

                                One way to enhance SSH login security is by using two-factor authentication (2FA). This approach forces an administrator to self-identify with an additional security verification in addition to the local admin credentials. This tutorial guides you through setting up Google Authenticator PAM to enable 2FA for users connecting to SSH on a Linux server. We’ll use nano as our editor in examples.so Save the updated file and exit the editor. Now, save the changes and exit the editor.

                                SSH client configuration files allow us to connect to servers with pre-configured commands. This saves typing each SSH command parameter when logging into a remote machine and executing commands on a remote device. This article will examine secure shell (SSH) client configuration (config) files and their functions. Specifically, we will show an example of an SSH client config file to learn how to use these files before creating an example config file that connects to a fictitious server.example.

                                Strictly following security best practices is the first step to cybersecurity. Although SSH is the industry standard for both security and efficacy for remote server access, as with any software, SSH is only as secure as configurations applied to the server and client configurations. In this article, we’ll explore five SSH best practices you should observe to boost the security of your infrastructure. 1. More secure second factors include YubiKey and Apple TouchID. 2. More on that below. 3. 4.

                                Audit logging for SSH is essential for system security, and it’s often an important part of compliance regulations. Developers and administrators should only be granted access to the resources they need, and a continuous monitoring system should be in place to ensure that they aren’t abusing that access. In this article, we’ll explore some methods you can use for SSH audit logging, including creating trackable logs, preventing log manipulation, and using an interactive logging tool.log file.g.g.

It’s a free game where you play either an adventurer or a fortress full of dwarves in a randomly generated fantasy world. The simulation runs deep, with new games creating multiple civilizations with histories, mythologies, and artifacts. I reached out to him to see how he’s managed a single, growing codebase over 15&#43; years, the perils of pathing, and debugging dead cats.

More specifically, we often discuss best practices around accelerating the time to value of 5G and simplifying the deployment and management of networks as well as the applications deployed on top of them.

The TPU VM architecture allows the ML practitioners to work directly on the host where TPU hardware is attached. With the TPU profiler launched earlier this year, debugging your PyTorch training on TPU VM is simpler than ever before.

Beyond the fact that bills separate people from their money, which can be painful for many, too often the online bill-paying process compounds the challenges: To pay some bills, you might have to log in to your bank’s clunky website or mobile banking app. For others, you may have limited payment options or they may not accept your favourite credit card.  We understand your pain.
