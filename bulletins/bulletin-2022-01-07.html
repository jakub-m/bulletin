                                In Superintelligence: The Idea That Eats Smart People , Maciej Pinboard nee Cegłowski talks about analyzing AI risk with the perspective of the “outside view”: Say that some people show up at your front door one day wearing funny robes, asking you if you will join their movement. They believe that a UFO is going to visit Earth two years from now, and it is our task to prepare humanity for the Great Upbeaming. […] The outside view tells you something different. Yes. Yes. Yup. No. Nope.  ↩

                                Even if you’ve used Docker for your smaller or locally developed software, you might find that it can be daunting for more complex tasks. This can especially be true for secrets management and sharing—areas often overlooked when working with containerized applications. There isn’t a standardized approach for accessing and managing secrets in containers, which has resulted in homegrown or inadequate solutions better geared for more static environments.env variables during debugging.25.

                                The Role of the CDO in the Data Mesh World The relevance of a Chief Data Office and their organization relies heavily on how the organization views its data. If data is a ‘by-product’ of process and systems, then the CDO organization will only be another function that is just adding unnecessary costs to the overall run-rate of the real business. The Data Mesh by Zhamak Dehghani challenges organizations to think different about their data. Both viewpoints are correct. And thus came the Data Mesh.

The last value for last year is December 31, 2021 at 23:59, and in this format it becomes 2112312359. That just fits into a signed 32 bit number (which tops out at 2147483647).

                                One of the things that makes DNS difficult to understand is that it’s decentralized . There are thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands? I don’t know!) of authoritative nameservers, and at least 10 million resolvers . And they’re running lots of different software! All these different servers running software means that there’s a lot of inconsistency in how DNS works, which can cause all kinds of frustrating problems. This is very important but it’s not what this post is about.io maps 10.0.0.1.0.

There are many ways application environments can be separated. Different namespaces within a single cluster, different clusters within a single cloud provider or different clusters across multiple cloud providers and/or bare metal.g.

                                SSH client configuration files allow us to connect to servers with pre-configured commands. This saves typing each SSH command parameter when logging into a remote machine and executing commands on a remote device. This article will examine secure shell (SSH) client configuration (config) files and their functions. Specifically, we will show an example of an SSH client config file to learn how to use these files before creating an example config file that connects to a fictitious server.example.

Although SSH is the industry standard for both security and efficacy for remote server access, as with any software, SSH is only as secure as configurations applied to the server and client configurations. In this article, we’ll explore five SSH best practices you should observe to boost the security of your infrastructure. 1. More secure second factors include YubiKey and Apple TouchID. 2.

Developers and administrators should only be granted access to the resources they need, and a continuous monitoring system should be in place to ensure that they aren’t abusing that access. In this article, we’ll explore some methods you can use for SSH audit logging, including creating trackable logs, preventing log manipulation, and using an interactive logging tool.log file.g.g.

                                As communication service providers (CSPs) continue to focus on capitalizing on the promise of 5G, I’ve been having more conversations with operators and network equipment providers on why and how it may make sense to adopt cloud-native approaches. More specifically, we often discuss best practices around accelerating the time to value of 5G and simplifying the deployment and management of networks as well as the applications deployed on top of them.

Beyond the fact that bills separate people from their money, which can be painful for many, too often the online bill-paying process compounds the challenges: To pay some bills, you might have to log in to your bank’s clunky website or mobile banking app. For others, you may have limited payment options or they may not accept your favourite credit card.  We understand your pain.

This transition is the latest in a long list of reasons agencies are looking for solutions to help train their workforce digitally. Google Drive stores training materials securely.

                                A “one size fits all” approach to education no longer works in today’s classrooms. Using cloud-based technologies, schools and educators can take a more personalized approach to education–one that suits each student’s unique learning style, abilities, and needs. In a student survey by EDUCAUSE , a nonprofit association whose mission is to advance higher education through the use of information technology, nearly all respondents asked for more digital learning and study options.
