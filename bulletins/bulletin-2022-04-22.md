The extension being installed automatically along with the Adobe Acrobat application, chances are that they don’t even know about it. But security-wise it doesn’t matter, an extension that’s installed and unused could still be exploited by malicious actors. So a few months ago I decided to take a look.

Hi everyone, A brief note, I’ve written a book, and the content is nearly done. You can read all about it here. The first 90% of the project went well, but I need (well paid) help with the remaining 90% to turn it into a decent book. This is a ‘for profit’ book, but it will be given away for free to schools, universities and readers/students unable to afford it. So there is a bit of feel-good factor involved.

Onboarding and offboarding are some of the biggest operational challenges that face organizations today. When an employee switches teams, goes on leave, or exits, an admin typically deactivates them in their identity provider—and unfortunately, in 2022, that’s a recurring management burden. Access rules can include groups, which allow you to easily grant access to many users for the same resources, such as those on the same team or in the same role.com&#34; , &#34;bob@example.

I am really, really into cooking. In the heady days of 2016 I regularly threw dinner parties for 30&#43; people. These days I don’t hate myself that much, but it’s still a big part of my life. I know more about my city’s best grocery stores than its best restaurants and regularly bring homemade candy to conferences. I really like cooking. In order to cook well, you need to practice mise en place : prepping all your ingredients before you start cooking. That helped me work out the credential setup.

## [Client Zero Protocol: Taking intelligent risks to go beyond the traditional SDLC control framework](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/client-zero-protocol--taking-intelligent-risks-to-go-beyond-the-)


Introduction Traditional IT processes supporting change management rely on a clear separation of the environments involved in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Developments and Unit Tests are performed in the “Development” environments, Quality Assurance and User Tests are conducted in the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) environments, and the “Production” environment is the sacred place where only real-life transactions and activities are performed.

This VLDB&#39;17 paper investigates the effects of distributed concurrency control protocols on performance of distributed transactional databases. They evaluate six protocols: two-phase locking with NO_WAIT and WAIT_DIE flavors, timestamp ordering (TIMESTAMP), multi-version concurrency control (MVCC), optimistic concurrency control (OCC), and a deterministic protocol Calvin. For the evaluations, they use an in-memory distributed database evaluation framework called Deneva ( https://github.e.g.5.6).

I was in the park with my son and his best friend. I saw 2 missed calls from a number I didn’t recognise. I Googled it - it was my bank. I told the other adults that I should call back in case it was important. This was mistake number 1. Nothing the bank might want to talk about could be urgent enough to interrupt an unseasonably sunny March afternoon. I got through to the bank, but they couldn’t work out why they had called me.

As a product manager, it’s important to hone the minimum set of activities that allow you to keep a product line moving forward productively. One of the most important core product management skills: the ability to triage unsuccessful products and avoid spending unnecessary effort on products that are destined to be losers. A few common ways that this can happen: Your CEO demands that you build a feature that they’re confident will help you win your market. Everything you build should add value.

## [Vampire Attack Twitter](https://geohot.github.io//blog/jekyll/update/2022/04/16/vampire-attack-twitter.html)


Here’s a simple way to take over Twitter for way less than $43 billion dollars. For reference, this is a vampire attack , perhaps best popularized by SushiSwap. The creators on Twitter are the liquidity providers, the lurkers are the users. It’s hard to create a new platform because you need both to move at once. Here’s a simple way to solve that. Step 1: Make a clone of Twitter on a blockchain, TWITCHAIN, with a native currency of TWITCOIN. Make the UI clean and responsive.

However, it’s important to note that Docker containers and VMs do not make for an apples-to-apples comparison. One is not inherently better than the other, with each having its pros and cons and use cases that might be better suited to one than the other.dev . Earthly.

Both software testing methods are vital to writing and maintaining a high-quality production codebase. But they are not sufficient on their own. Your team’s testing practice should assess the entire application, observe the larger story of how it operates when functioning correctly, and raise alarms when deviations are found. Unit tests are limited though.

Back in 2010, Google signed its first-ever agreement to purchase 114 MW of wind power in Iowa. This deal made us an early pioneer of corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) — contracts to purchase renewable energy directly from developers on the same grids where we operate our data centers.  Signing PPAs is a critical first step, but typically these deals are signed before a project breaks ground. What’s really exciting is when those deals start producing clean energy to the grid.
