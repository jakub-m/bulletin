## [Building Successful Business Partnerships With Productivity In Mind: Steps To Follow.](https://www.carlpullein.com/blog/building-successful-business-partnerships-with-productivity-in-mind-steps-to-follow/20/3/2024)


Are business partnerships worth the effort? A report shared in Forbes reveals partnerships boost revenue, create new opportunities, and boost innovation. For example, Microsoft generates 95% of its commercial revenue through a partnership ecosystem. What a successful partnership with suppliers or other entrepreneurs does is bring two or more talents together, improving productivity and fuelling innovation, which are vital in sales generation. This is a guest post by the wonderful Lucy Rose.

Modern developer platforms can redefine software development and enable DevOps at scale. Reference architectures provide a starting blueprint for their design. These factors contribute to what we call “developer velocity”  — a key driver of business success. Previous McKinsey research has found that companies with top-quartile developer velocity outperform bottom-quartile companies by four to five times (measured in revenue CAGR). Run the platform team like a start-up. Define success as usage.

It&#39;s not unusual for the data brokers behind people-search websites to use pseudonyms in their day-to-day lives (you would, too). Some of these personal data purveyors even try to reinvent their online identities in a bid to hide their conflicts of interest. But it&#39;s not every day you run across a US-focused people-search network based in China whose principal owners all appear to be completely fabricated identities.

De hele korte versie: een minister voor Digitale Zaken heeft alleen zin als deze minstens evenveel doorzettingsmacht krijgt als de minister van Financiën. En het werkt ook alleen als die nieuwe minister een agenda heeft waarbij ICT veel meer is dan “iets wat je inkoopt”, maar echt een kernactiviteit wordt waar geïnnoveerd kan worden. En dat vergt een nieuwe erkenning van ICT-ambtenaren als daadwerkelijk belangrijke mensen, die aan de knoppen zitten en dingen mogen veranderen.

At Replit, session success rate is one of our service level objectives (SLOs). This means that any legitimate incoming request from a client should always be successfully connected to its target Repl. Failure to do so is a bad user experience. To abstract away intermittent infrastructure failures when you connect to a Repl, we use a reverse WebSocket proxy between the user’s client and the remote VM hosting Conman, our container manager that runs all Repls in a container.

## [What if the spec doesn&#39;t match the code?](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/what-if-the-spec-doesnt-match-the-code/)


Whenever I talk about formal methods, I get the same question: Can I use the spec to generate my code? People are worried about two things. One, that they&#39;ll make a mistake implementing the specification and have bugs. Two, that over time the implementation will &#34;drift&#34; and people won&#39;t update the spec, leading to unexpected design issues.

Custom project statuses You can now create custom statuses for your projects. Custom statuses help you share more context about where a project is in its lifecycle and what steps are needed to move the project forward. Go to workspace settings &gt; projects to create or modify statuses under the categories: Backlog, Planned, Started, Completed, and Canceled. If your workspace has any paused projects, they&#39;ll now be assigned a Paused status under the Planned category.g. Project.status.

This dataset is made up of 1.1 billion taxi trips conducted in New York City between 2009 and 2015. This is the same dataset I&#39;ve used to benchmark Amazon Athena, BigQuery, BrytlytDB, DuckDB, Elasticsearch, EMR, Hydrolix, kdb&#43;/q, MapD / OmniSci / HEAVY.AI, PostgreSQL, Redshift and Vertica.

DuckDB is an in-process database. Rather than relying on a server of its own, it&#39;s used as a client. The client can work with data in memory, within DuckDB&#39;s internal file format, database servers from other software developers and cloud storage services such as AWS S3. This choice to not centralise DuckDB&#39;s data within its own server, paired with being distributed as a single binary, makes installing and working with DuckDB much less complex than say, standing up a Hadoop Cluster.1 GHz .10.10..

When you’re driving a car down a road, you might get a bit stuffy and decide to roll your windows down. The air will flow in, the wind will get louder, and the sensation of moving will intensify. Your engine will start working a bit harder–and louder–to maintain the same speed. Every sensation will tell you that you’re moving faster, but lowering the window has increased your car’s air resistance, and you’re actually going slower. Or at minimum you’re using more fuel to maintain the same speed.

And in fact, it’s almost exactly the opposite. It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human. Everybody in the world is now a programmer.

Here is a non-realistic scenario: You are choosing the programming language for what will eventually become something large. Picture a collection of services in a mono repo, with over 100 people working on it. To keep this extra unrealistic, let’s say you’re ignoring the usual constraints, like whether you can afford GC, or whether the problem fits well with a specific tech stack or whatever. it’s a thought experiment.

Grafana Beyla, an open source eBPF auto-instrumentation tool, has been able to produce OpenTelemetry trace spans since we introduced the project . However, the traces produced by the initial versions of Grafana Beyla were single span OpenTelemetry traces, which means the trace context information was limited to a single service view. Beyla was able to ingest TraceID information passed to the instrumented service, but was unable to propagate it upstream to other services.3 release.3/beyla-1.

Integrating monitoring and logging into your application stack is crucial for maintaining performance, enhancing security, and streamlining troubleshooting. Grafana Cloud offers a robust solution for monitoring your applications by collecting metrics and logs using an agent, such as Grafana Agent , but there are many environments where this isn’t feasible. Similarly, batch jobs may only run for a brief period, so pull-based tools might miss the opportunity window for pulling metrics. 1. 2. 3. 4.

GR00T First, let’s talk about GR00T (short for “ Generalist Robot 00 Technology ”).” Robots powered by GR00T...

## [Nvidia Unveils Blackwell, Its Next GPU](https://spectrum.ieee.org/nvidia-blackwell)


Today at Nvidia’s developer conference, GTC 2024 , the company revealed its next GPU, the B200 . The B200 is capable of delivering four times the training performance, up to 30 times the inference performance, and up to 25 times better energy efficiency, compared to its predecessor, the Hopper H100 GPU . Based on the new Blackwell architecture, the GPU can be combined with the company’s Grace CPUs to form a new generation of DGX SuperPOD computers capable of up to 11.S.8 TB/s.

## [How Ultrasound Became Ultra Small](https://spectrum.ieee.org/mems-ultrasound-history)


A startling change in medical ultrasound is working its way through hospitals and physicians’ offices. The long-standing, state-of-the-art ultrasound machine that’s pushed around on a cart, with cables and multiple probes dangling, is being wheeled aside permanently in favor of handheld probes that send images to a phone. And the AI that accompanies them may soon make these devices operable by untrained professionals in any setting—not just trained sonographers in clinics.

## [China and Norway Lead the World’s EV Switchover](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-adoption-2030-goals)


The U.S. government recently backed down from enacting tough new measures that would have forced automakers to quadruple their sales of electric vehicles by 2030. Even if Washington hadn’t buckled to outside pressure, the U.S. ambitions for 2030 would not have been exceptional. The move would have raised market share of all-electric vehicles in the U.S. to a level still well below 20 percent. Meanwhile, there is a growing group of nations with their sights set much higher.5 degrees C (2.S.S.S.

## [How Zipline Designed Its Droid Delivery System](https://spectrum.ieee.org/delivery-drone-zipline-design)


About a year ago, Zipline introduced Platform 2 , an approach to precision urban drone delivery that combines a large hovering drone with a smaller package-delivery “Droid.” Lowered on a tether from the belly of its parent Zip drone, the Droid contains thrusters and sensors (plus a 2.5- to 3.5-kilogram payload) to reliably navigate itself to a delivery area of just one meter in diameter. The Zip, meanwhile, safely remains hundreds of meters up. First, a quick refresher.

## [The Heart and the Chip: What Could Go Wrong?](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-heart-and-the-chip-what-could-go-wrong)


Legendary MIT roboticist Daniela Rus has published a new book called The Heart and the Chip: Our Bright Future with Robots . “There is a robotics revolution underway,” Rus says in the book’s introduction, “one that is already causing massive changes in our society and in our lives.” She’s quite right, of course, and although some of us have been feeling that this is true for decades, it’s arguably more true right now than it ever has been. Remember, robots are tools.W. Norton &amp; Company.

## [Why Are Large AI Models Being Red Teamed?](https://spectrum.ieee.org/red-team-ai-llms)


In February, OpenAI announced the arrival of Sora , a stunning “text-to-video” tool. Simply enter a prompt, and Sora generates a realistic video within seconds. But it wasn’t immediately available to the public. Some of the delay is because OpenAI reportedly has a set of experts called a red team who, the company has said, will probe the model to understand its capacity for deepfake videos, misinformation, bias, and hateful content. The practice originated in U.S. That’s the idea, at least.S.S.

## [Who Will Free EV Motors from the Rare Earth Monopoly?](https://spectrum.ieee.org/electric-motor-no-rare-earth)


As the world builds more and more electric cars and trucks—and electrifies other modes of transit—a race is underway to build the ideal, mean-and-green motor. The goal is a traction motor that’s at least as powerful, reliable, and lightweight as today’s industry standard rare-earth permanent magnet synchronous motor . However, rare-earth elements like neodymium and dysprosium, which are required for the most powerful magnets for the latter, also represent a major choke point.7 kW.1 and 3.K.”
