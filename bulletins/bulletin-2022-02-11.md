Everyone repeats like a mantra that tests are an indispensable element of development work. Is there anything to it? Well, I need to admit that as a developer, I rather often want to skip the test writing stage. I assume I’m not the only one. I’m aware that it’s a mistake, even with testers on board. Effective and efficient testing of your own code can help with catching bugs in new functionalities, as well as in changes to already existing ones. It cannot be questioned.11.2kB minified (127.1...

I’ve been using gulp.js as the build system of choice for my browser extensions for a while. Last week I suddenly felt an urge to develop something better, and now I have PfP being built by my very own build system. Did I suddenly succumb to the NIH syndrome ? Well, I believe that I have good reasons to develop something better than gulp. And the time investment is quite moderate given the time already sunk into maintaining build configurations. So you rely on gulp plugins to do it. contents .

Docker is a common containerization solution that offers a user-friendly interface. It allows you to deploy your application as a lightweight process set rather than a complete virtual machine. Docker images are like a snapshot of a container’s file system and contain both your application and its dependencies. When you run it, you recreate the container’s state. However, containers often need to use data beyond their container or share data between containers./target/index. version : &#34;3.txt .

I ran into an interesting algorithm while hacking on Advent of Code a while ago. This post is a summary of what I&#39;ve learned. Consider a binary tree that represents nested pairs, where each pair consists of two kinds of elements: a number, or another pair. Each node in the tree has either 0 or 2 children. A non-empty tree has at least one internal node. The depth starts from 0 at the root - this is what the numbered lines in the diagram above represent. If it&#39;s still not 100% clear, that&#39;s OK...

From Anatomy of the State : Social power is the power over nature…State power is power over man I probably had read this idea before when I said it , but I don’t recall when. Perhaps it’s just an obvious dichotomy. I like the linking of one to state power and one to “social power” First, renounce your own desire for state power. The problem with the state is that is it bad, not that the wrong people are in it. If you cannot renounce this desire, fuck off. You are the problem. Exit. Nothing.

That is, if you started something, it might inherit one or more things from your environment. This story involves a lot of weird little things going back a ways.....

Co-authors: Yunbo Ouyang,Viral Gupta, Kinjal Basu, Cyrus Diciccio, Brendan Gavin, and Lin Guo. Most large-scale recommender systems like newsfeed ranking, people recommendations, job recommendations, etc., have multiple objectives that need to be simultaneously optimized. These objectives may include things like user engagement, diversity, novelty, freshness, or fairness. These objectives can sometimes be conflicting, so there is a need to balance them.

To make effective business decisions, managers need visibility into the entire testing process, in a way that will help them understand what needs to be done and how.

Often referred to as AuthN (authentication) and AuthZ (authorization) in the modern access control paradigm, both authentication and authorization are a method to control access to resources. These resources can be files, programs, web applications, mobile applications, operating systems, network devices, etc. Let’s explore three common scenarios on how authentication and authorization are involved.

GitOps is a set of principles for you to implement continuous deployment for cloud-native applications using Git as a single source of truth. With GitOps, you treat everything, including infrastructure, as source code and store it in Git. GitOps lets you automatically deploy code as soon as it is committed to a Git repository. Modern cloud-native tools make up this new pipeline. In this post, we list the most vital tools that makeup a GitOps pipeline. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

Canary deployments or progressive delivery is a technique for deploying new features and fixes at speed while minimising risk. We all know that the best way to break any code is to deploy it into production; it worked just fine in staging. Rather than deploy a new release directly into production, it can be deployed in such a way that initially only a small percentage of requests get the new release until we’re sure it’s going to work. This is called progressive delivery or a canary release.96.

## [How tech companies and startups get to market faster with containers on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/startups/google-cloud-container-tips-for-startups-and-tech-companies/)

Be sure to check out the full whitepaper for all the details...

## [Long-running containers with Workflows and Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/long-running-containers-workflows-and-compute-engine/)


Sometimes, you need to run a piece of code for hours, days, or even weeks. Cloud Functions and Cloud Run are my default choices to run code. However, they both have limitations on how long a function or container can run. This rules out the idea of executing long-running code in a serverless way.  Thanks to Workflows and Compute Engine, you can have an almost serverless experience with long running code.  Here’s the idea: Containerize the long-running task, so it can run anywhere.yaml ...

## [Five ways to stop automated website attacks with reCAPTCHA Enterprise](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/public-sector/five-ways-stop-automated-website-attacks-recaptcha-enterprise/)


Automated website attacks have become a staple of cybercrime, with bots serving as one of the easiest ways a bad actor can threaten websites. Bots can be used to steal sensitive information and money, or they can shut a website down entirely. Bots are being used to threaten all types of online activity each day for government agencies, costing billions of dollars each year and going beyond the simple, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. 1.
