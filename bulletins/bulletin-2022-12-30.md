## [2022: A Year in GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/2022-a-year-in-gitops)


This year, GitOps really gathered momentum in the enterprise, thanks in no small part to a series of big Weaveworks milestones, from integration with Microsoft’s developer tools to the graduation of Flux at the CNCF. So let’s take a quick look back over the last twelve months. 2022 was a big year for GitOps and an even bigger year for Weaveworks. It has been a sustained effort that has culminated in Flux, the open-source project that powers Weave GitOps, reaching Graduated status in the CNCF.g.

## [Avatar 2 was Bad](https://geohot.github.io//blog/jekyll/update/2022/12/27/avatar-2-was-bad.html)


Spoliers below the line, and this probably won’t make sense if you didn’t see the movie. I don’t understand how the budget can be so high for movies like this, and the plot and characters be so terrible. Feels like ChatGPT wrote it. The movie is beautiful and the world building is epic, which is why the story upsets me. For reference, I loved Avatar 1, and thought there was so much potential here. So get in losers, we are going to fix Avatar 2: Titanic Edition. We diverge 10 minutes in.

## [The AI Big Bang](https://acjay.com/2022/12/23/the-ai-big-bang/)


While only the most jaded person could see what&#39;s going on in AI and not be completely blown away, there is debate around exactly what the socioeconomic implications of this new phase of AI will be. On one hand, you have people already predicting that we&#39;re in the end game for white collar workers, such as artists, writers, and software developers. Other folks, perhaps more attuned to the limitation of the AIs we&#39;ve seen, are urging a much more sober outlook.

KrebsOnSecurity turns 12 years old today. That&#39;s a crazy long time for an independent media outlet these days, but then again I&#39;m liable to keep doing this as long as they keep letting me! Thanks to your readership and support, I was able to spend more time in 2022 on in-depth investigative stories -- the really satisfying kind with the potential to affect positive change. Some of that work is highlighted in the 2022 Year in Breaches review below.

## [Enterprise Retention Means Solving Hard Problems](https://staysaasy.com/product/2022/12/28/enterprise-retention-solving-hard-problems.html)


Enterprise products defend their long-term value by solving really hard problems. To see why, here’s a common enterprise customer lifecycle: You build a useful product. A large enterprise company buys it. You support your product. Enterprise teams are like airplanes where new people and crews are constantly joining and departing the same hull; the customer’s team evolves as people are promoted, hired, fired, and reorganized. One day, a new customer leader decides to re-evaluate their software.

That claimed to be 64 or 128 bits, but was closer to 40 or 104 due to the whole 24-bit &#34;IV&#34; thing, and a whole bunch of dumb problems with the crypto generally meant it was weaker than that in practice.

LastPass has been breached, data has been stolen. I already pointed out that their official statement is misleading. I also explained that decrypting passwords in the stolen data is possible which doesn’t mean however that everybody is at risk now. For assessing whether you are at risk, a fairly hidden setting turned out critical: password iterations. LastPass provides an instruction to check this setting . One would expect it to be 100,100 (the LastPass default) for almost everyone. And here .

Right before the holiday season, LastPass published an update on their breach . As people have speculated, this timing was likely not coincidental but rather intentional to keep the news coverage low. Security professionals weren’t amused, this holiday season became a very busy time for them. LastPass likely could have prevented this if they were more concerned about keeping their users secure than about saving their face. Their statement is also full of omissions, half-truths and outright lies.

## [What data does LastPass encrypt?](https://palant.info/2022/12/24/what-data-does-lastpass-encrypt/)


A few days ago LastPass admitted that unknown attackers copied their “vault data.” It certainly doesn’t help that LastPass failed to clarify which parts of the vaults are encrypted and which are not. LastPass support adds to the confusion by stating that password notes aren’t encrypted which I’m quite certain is wrong. In fact, it’s pretty easy to view your own LastPass data. And it shows that barely anything changed since I wrote about their “encrypted vault” myth four years go.com/getaccts.

## [LastPass has been breached: What now?](https://palant.info/2022/12/23/lastpass-has-been-breached-what-now/)


If you have a LastPass account you should have received an email updating you on the state of affairs concerning a recent LastPass breach. While this email and the corresponding blog post try to appear transparent, they don’t give you a full picture. This makes it sound like decrypting the passwords you stored with LastPass is impossible. It also prepares the ground for blaming you, should the passwords be decrypted after all: you clearly didn’t follow the recommendations. This seems like a lot.
