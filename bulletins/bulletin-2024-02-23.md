## [Kubernetes CPU Limits and Go](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2024/02/kubernetes-cpu-limits-go.html)


Introduction I was working on a Go service that was going to be deployed into a managed Kubernetes (K8s) environment on GCP. One day I wanted to look at the logs in the staging environment and got access to the ArgoCD platform. In the process of trying to find the logs, I stumbled upon the YAML that described the deployment configuration for my service. I was shocked to see that the CPU limit was set to 250m.

The Bendix Central Air Data Computer (CADC) is an electromechanical analog computer that uses gears and cams for its mathematics. It was a key part of military planes such as the F-101 and the F-111 fighters, computing airspeed, Mach number, and other &#34;air data&#34;. The rotating gears are powered by six small servomotors, so these motors are in a sense the fundamental component of the CADC. In the photo below, you can see one of the cylindrical motors near the center, about 1/3 of the way down.g.S.

I’ve been exploring .NET Aspire as a pattern for how to build .NET apps, and when checking the features of the Preview 3 release I noticed something interesting, a new service connector for using OpenAI/Azure OpenAI. We knew this was coming, I was following the PR for it, and given I’ve been doing a lot of AI stuff it made sense to try it out. Before we can use the service connector we need to setup the resource in the AppHost:

Our world needs creative people. These people change things; they find solutions to seemingly impossible problems and make the world interesting. Yet, for some reason, because they often work differently from the way “normal” people do, we label them as having ADHD, Autism or other similar conditions. What did Leonardo Da Vinci and Isaac Newton have in common? They both had what we call severe ADHD today. I guess that many of you who read the above paragraph can relate to it. I certainly can.

Planning very roughly is: You provide a start state, a set of goals, and a set of state transitions (actions), The planner uses the actions to generate a state space, The planner reports a sequence of actions that reaches a goal, if any. These look extremely similar, and in fact they are mathematically the same thing.  ↩

Individual Contributor (IC) engineers are unique in that they are the majority of any cross-functional development team, often outnumbering PM and design by 7-to-1 or more. This scale leads many to start to think of engineers as a commodity. This is a mistake. For example, agile team planning sometimes tries to make engineering resources seem interchangeable. This is wrong. People have different skills and abilities.g. Top ICs and managers are extremely discerning about who they work with.

This paper appeared in VLDB 2019 . Benchmarks are a necessary evil for database evaluation. Benchmarks often focus on narrow aspects and specific workloads, creating a misleading picture for broader real-world applications/workloads. However, for a quick performance snapshot, benchmarks remain a crucial tool.0). Standard RDBMS benchmarks haven’t been a good fit for MongoDB either, since they require normalized relational schema and SQL operations.0 in 2019.

This is Chapter 3 from the Transaction Processing Book Gray/Reuter 1992 . Why does the fault-tolerance discussion come so early in the book? We haven&#39;t even started talking about transactional programming styles, concurrency theory, concurrency control. The reason is that the book uses dealing with failures as a motivation for adopting transaction primitives and a transactional programming style. The chapter starts with an astounding observation.

Whether you’re applying to your first internship to running a multidisciplinary team of analysts and engineers, data science careers come with their own specific set of challenges. Some of these might be more exciting than others, and others can be downright tedious—that’s true in any job, of course—but we believe in framing all of these potential drawbacks as opportunities to deepen your knowledge, expand your skill set, and consider new viewpoints.

QLoRA — How to Fine-Tune an LLM on a Single GPU An introduction with Python example code (ft. Mistral-7b) This article is part of a larger series on using large language models (LLMs) in practice. In the previous post , we saw how to fine-tune an LLM using OpenAI. The main limitation to this approach, however, is that OpenAI’s models are concealed behind their API, which limits what and how we can build with them. The key challenge is that LLMs are (very) computationally expensive (i.e.g.3, 83.

Many companies that use GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 in production have realized that these models are simply not scalable from a cost perspective.
