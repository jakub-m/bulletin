                                Republished from Teleport’s official blog ( link ) Z3 is a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver developed by Microsoft Research. With a description like that you’d expect it to be restricted to esoteric corners of the computerized mathematics world, but it’s made impressive inroads addressing conventional software engineering needs: analyzing network ACLs and firewalls in Microsoft Azure, for example. Anyway, here’s how you’d write this in Python: import z3 solver = z3 . Solver() x = z3 .

                                If you programmed something and it turns out to be too slow, often you’d like to farm out the work to multiple threads. At this point you typically have a few choices: use some kind of producer/consumer pipe half-ass it by dividing the work into n chunks and launch n threads and hope for the best rely on one of the magic parallelization solutions (#pragma omp) use (newfangled) language features All of these options are painful to some extent.

                                In programming, we often represent numbers using types that have specific ranges. For example, 64-bit signed integer types can represent all integers between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807, inclusively. All integers inside this range are valid, all integers outside are “out of range”. It is simple. What about floating-point numbers? The nuance with floating-point numbers is that … Continue reading What is the ‘range’ of a number type?

You find gonum, which has some plotting capabilities, but it generates static charts. It’s 2022, and you’d like to have interactive features such as zooming, panning, and more. You turn to the HTML landscape, and see many more options and decide to take this path. After a short survey, you decide to use plotly.

In exploring that question, the topic of mental models came up frequently. Mental model is a somewhat overloaded term, but roughly means having a structured view on a given topic. For managers, it’s usually easiest to see in evolving process.

                                When I first learned about it, DNS didn’t seem like it should be THAT complicated. Like, there are DNS records, they’re stored on a server, what’s the big deal? But with DNS, reading about how it works in a textbook doesn’t prepare you for the sheer volume of different ways DNS can break your system in practice. It’s not just caching problems! So I asked people on Twitter for example of DNS problems they’ve run into, especially DNS problems that didn’t initially appear to be DNS problems .64.0.

                                DynamoDB&#39;s Best Feature: Predictability Happy birthday! It&#39;s 10 years since the launch of DynamoDB , Amazon&#39;s fast, scalable, NoSQL database. Back when DynamoDB launched, I was leading the team rethinking the control plane of EBS . At the time, we had a large number of manually-administered MySQL replication trees, which were giving us a lot of operational pain. Writes went to a single primary, and reads came from replicas, with lots of eventual consistency and weird anomalies in the mix.

                                My cat is a great communicator. Today, just before noon, he meowed in front of my room. When I opened the door, he walked down the stairs till halfway, stopped, looked back at me, made eye contact, and meowed again. When I started following him, he passed the living room, stopped, looked back at me, meowed again, and waited for me to catch up. He then led me to the kitchen next to his feeder, and made me feed him. Many technical people forget this first rule of communication. Divide and conquer.

As our subscribers grow worldwide and Netflix enters the world of gaming , the number of batch workflows and real-time data pipelines increases rapidly. And we can’t discount the productivity impact it causes on data platform users. These steps launch jobs on clusters running Apache Spark and TrinoDb via Genie .

                                Introduction  Building platforms is a hard business. Building platforms for discerning machine learning (ML) practitioners with bespoke needs and a do-it-yourself ethos is even harder. In today’s post, we will give you a peek into how we built ML Home, the internal user interface for Spotify’s Machine Learning Platform, and the product lessons we learned [...]

                                At growth companies, complexity kills. The reason is simple - complexity is slow, and slow don’t grow. For example, say the software you’re building has a piece of code that has been optimized for the last 4 years, mostly by one SME. It might run 40% faster than a simpler, less optimized version. But it’s become very complex, and even SME has some trouble keeping all of it in their head at once. One final, critical detail - the code is not bad code. It’s actually very good code.

                                “We have to make data emotional because emotions are what drive us to act,” says  Chip Heath , a professor of organizational behavior and author of the new book,  Making Numbers Count: The Art of Science of Communicating Numbers . In this interview with podcast host Matt Abrahams, Heath talks about ways that data and statistics can be used to illuminate — or obscure — our message. “A lot of people in the world don’t understand numbers like the numbers people,” he says.

                                Posted by Oran Lang and Inbar Mosseri, Software Engineers, Google Research Neural networks can perform certain tasks remarkably well, but understanding how they reach their decisions — e.g., identifying which signals in an image cause a model to determine it to be of one class and not another — is often a mystery . These insights can also be helpful in guiding health care providers, revealing model biases, providing support for downstream decision makers, and even aiding scientific discovery.g.

                                Kubernetes is open source software for deploying, scaling and managing containerized applications. As an orchestrator, it handles the work of scheduling containers on a cluster and also manages the workloads, to ensure they run as you intended.    Because Kubernetes was designed from the outset with the idea of software development and operations working together, operations tasks and how they get performed represent an integral component of Kubernetes’ architecture and design.

Simultaneously, DevOps as a culture has taken off and has become almost the default approach to software development, testing, and deployment, allowing organizations to accelerate the pace at which they deliver applications and services to customers.

                                The SSH agent ( ssh-agent ) is an SSH key manager that stores the SSH key in a process memory so that users can log into SSH servers without having to type the key’s passphrase every time they authenticate with the server. In addition to the key management feature, SSH agent supports agent forwarding, which helps to authenticate with servers that sit behind a bastion or jump server . However, the more critical security risk is associated with SSH agent forwarding. 1. 2. 3. You can also update .

                                Z3 is a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver developed by Microsoft Research. With a description like that, you’d expect it to be restricted to esoteric corners of the computerized mathematics world, but it has made impressive inroads addressing conventional software engineering needs: analyzing network ACLs and firewalls in Microsoft Azure, for example. Z3 Automata was sadly never open-sourced, but the following years saw a ton of work put into Z3’s string and regex functionality.

                                Lack of access accountability and unmonitored access create a considerable security risk for organizations, and the best way to mitigate this challenge is by implementing identity-based access.” Identity-based access entails integrating identity providers with access providers with single sign-on (SSO) features to deliver an efficient and secure access method. In this article, we’ll talk about the features and advantages of identity-based access and how it can be used with SSH.

                                On today&#39;s Day Two Cloud we have a career conversation with Angela Andrews, a Solution Architect at Red Hat. Angela provides an introduction to OpenShift, a cloud-based offering for running and orchestrating Kubernetes containers in public clouds and on premises from Red Hat. We also discuss how to integrate communication skills with technical knowledge, the role of a Solution Architect, how to stay on top of new and changing technologies, and more.

We’ll get into stretching layer 2 safely, Pluribus&#39;s L3 capabilities, operational concerns of active/active when the DCs are many hundreds of miles apart, and the pressure of delivering customer-facing services that drove the selection of the Pluribus architecture.

Because they kept their main thing their main thing, and kept improving it every day for a couple of years, now your on-call can be simple too.

Go’s design lends itself nicely to computer generated authoring: thanks to go fmt, there’s already only one Go style. This means AI-generated code will be consistent and seamless. Its focus on simplicity &amp; readability make it tailor made for this new approach to software creation. Where might this take us?

He is talking with Drew Marshall, director at Trunk Networks and No One Internet, a Cloud Services Provider &amp; ISP based in Sussex, UK. Gerhard’s Vodafone ISP gateway was losing packets, and recording some of the previous episodes used to be challenging as his internet connection would cut out up to 10 seconds at a time, multiple times per recording session. He was convinced that his Unifi Dream Machine Pro was not the issue.

                                Welcome to a new way of exploring Google Cloud products. Finding your favorite products and discovering new ones requires a user interface that’s easy-to-use, clear, informative, and delightful. Google Cloud users have primarily used our side menu to navigate, but with almost one hundred products and growing, it’s safe to say our product list has outgrown the side menu.  That’s why we created a new All products page to help you easily navigate to your favorite Google Cloud products.

                                If you manage sensitive data in your MySQL database, you might be obligated to record and monitor user database activity, especially if you work in a regulated industry. Although you could set up MySQL’s slow query log or general log to create an audit trail of user activity, these logs significantly impact database performance and aren’t formatted optimally for auditing. You can now define audit rules that govern which database activity is recorded. Read Article

                                When an alert fires from your applications, your team needs to know as soon as possible to mitigate any user-facing issues. Customers with complex operating environments rely on incident management or related services to organize and coordinate their responses to issues. They need the flexibility to route alert notifications to platforms or services in the formats that they can accept. You can configure your Google Cloud alerts to be sent to any vendor or custom-built tool used by your team.

                                Most businesses that have adopted off-site or hybrid working models over the last two years made the change under immense pressure. The need was incredibly urgent and timing was a major factor. Now that they’ve had a chance to adapt and settle in, leaders are revisiting how their teams work in a more proactive way. They’re updating strategies and policies with a focus on what will be best for both the company and the employees long term.  With this thinking, security requires a new approach.

                                Hybrid and multi-cloud environments produce a boundless array of logs including application and server logs, logs related to cloud services, APIs, orchestrators, gateways and just about anything else running in the environment. Due to this high volume, logging systems may become slow and unmanageable when you urgently need them to troubleshoot an issue, and even harder to use them to get insights. These insights did not need to be real-time., specifically related to their network logs.
