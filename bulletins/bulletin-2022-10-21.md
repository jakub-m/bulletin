Author’s note: I wrote this in 2018 and it languished in the drafts since then because I couldn’t think of a good conclusion. Really this is typical of the subject matter and all this piece offers is something to chew on, if you have the interest in it or have never before considered the question. At the time I was helping tutor a TLA&#43; seminar and had the opportunity to ask Leslie Lamport (who has thought about computation quite a bit!

Change is inevitable. Sometimes it is for the better, and other times there are little differences that you have to adjust to. But problems can happen when you have an inflexible system that cannot adapt to change. I recently relocate all of my services into a new hosting provider. My previous provider was going out of business , so I had to move everything fast. The good news is, I had enough time to plan things the move, so it was pretty painless. I can definitely tell the difference. (E.g.7.)

Now that I finally got it and read it, I&#39;m really happy I did. I think it&#39;s likely the best book I&#39;ve read this year, and one of the best works of non-fiction in recent memory.

## [Teaching Accidental and Essential Complexity](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/teaching-accidental-and-essential-complexity/)


So you may know that I’m teaching a 1-day TLA&#43; workshop in December ( just 10 slots left! ) This is unlike my normal workshops because it’s only 1 day and for 35 people instead of 3. 1 The two workshops share almost no content between them. To understand why, I need to go into a bit of teaching theory. For the 700 or so new readers, TLA&#43; is a form of formal specification language. You can make a design for a system and then directly test the design itself for bugs. There are two reasons why..

## [Why it&#39;s called &#34;MagicDNS&#34; instead of &#34;Magic DNS&#34;
](https://tailscale.com/blog/magicdns-why-name/)


Naming products is hard. One of Tailscale’s key features, MagicDNS, has long been a source of armchair grammar controversy. To wit: Some people think we should call it Magic DNS because Apple calls their flagship keyboard and mouse the Magic Keyboard and the Magic Mouse. A Magic Keyboard without the magic is still a keyboard. A MacBook without the Mac is not a book. MagicDNS is one word because without the magic, it wouldn’t just be DNS; it wouldn’t be anything.conf .com is and gets back 82.58.

## [MagicDNS is generally available](https://tailscale.com/blog/magicdns/)


Tailscale automatically assigns IP addresses for every unique device in your network, giving each device an IP address no matter where it is located. We further improved on this with MagicDNS , which automatically registers a human-readable, easy-to-remember DNS name for each device —  so you don’t need to use an IP address to access your devices. MagicDNS is such a useful feature that it’s been frustrating for us that not all Tailscale users know about it.ts.beta.tailscale.net . Also in v1.ts.

Most commonly, data teams have worked with structured data. Unstructured data, which includes images, documents, and videos, will account for up to 80 percent of data by 2025. However, organizations currently use only a small percentage of this data to derive useful insights.  One of main ways to extract value from unstructured data is by applying ML to the data. Performing such tasks is currently achievable by using services that host ML models for these operations.g. Twiddy &amp; Co.g.

Cloud is accelerating digital transformation, enabling organizations to build and release apps more frequently, and databases are at the center of this transformation. But the transition to Cloud has led to an increase in the number and variety of database engines that users have to manage. The operational burden of keeping up with scale and new software releases for each engine has forced database teams to be more reactive. These issues can usually be prevented if you take timely action. 2. 3.

In the current macroeconomic conditions, companies focus on identifying ways to reduce spending. To  effectively do that, we need to understand the pricing model. We can then work towards the challenges of cost monitoring, optimization, and forecasting. This can represent a significant cost, especially if it’s not optimized.
