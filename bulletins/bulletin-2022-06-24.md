By building such a solution we’ve learnt a lot about this technology and we would like to share it with you in this article. What’s GraphQL and how does it work? To understand how to increase GraphQL’s performance we need to understand how it works under the hood. Why is it so important?

A few weeks ago, an interesting HN thread caught my eye. When implementing an interpreter for a programming language, Lisp is often cited as a particularly attractive example due to its simplicity. Why is that? I&#39;ve really enjoyed implementing Lisp interpreters and compilers in the past [1] , so I&#39;d like to reflect a bit on this topic. But first, an important clarification: when I say &#34;Lisp&#34; I mean a family of languages, some of them minimal (like the original Lisp 1... (cadr e) a) (eval. (pair.

Tailscale SSH allows you to establish SSH connections between devices in your Tailscale network, as authorized by your access controls, without managing SSH keys, and authenticates your SSH connection using WireGuard®. Many organizations already use Tailscale to protect their SSH sessions — for example, to allow users to connect from their work laptop to their work desktop.” And so we did.

The public FotoForensics service only provides a small subset of the tools that we have for detecting alterated photos. We explicitly don&#39;t make everything available to the public. One of the big reasons for holding back the advanced algorithms is that I often see people using the public service to develop new fraud techniques. These developers often upload a series of pictures, each with minor changes, until they end up with a solution that is not detectable on the public site. 22 deg 9&#39; 58.

## [Seneca on Learning](https://tomgamon.com/posts/seneca-on-learning/)


I recently finished a collection of Seneca’s letters, in which there were a few lovely insights 1 . I found this one particularly relatable. As someone with ADHD I am particularly prone to rapidly flitting between subjects, but I am sure every developer has gone through stages in their growth when they just want to know everything all at once. What is wanted is neither haphazard dipping nor a greedy onslaught on knowledge in the mass. We mustn’t take on more than we can manage.  ↩︎

This tutorial covers: “Dockerizing” a Python application Setting up a pipeline to build and test an image Deploying the Docker image to Docker Hub CI/CD systems follow a multi-tiered environments pattern: development, testing, staging, and production release are all part of this process. Each setting in this cycle could have a variety of set ups and configurations. As a result, having to set up separate configurations for different environments could be inconvenient and burdensome.10.10.txt . .

## [Trunk-based vs. feature-based development](https://circleci.com/blog/trunk-vs-feature-based-dev/)


When you are the only dev building a software project, you can create and modify your code according to personal preference. When you contribute code to a team-run project, you need to follow a standardized set of guidelines and coordinate precisely with other team members. Standard guidelines and coordinated work effort are vital to the success of every team-based software development project. To address this need, engineering teams worldwide have devised many development workflows.

GitOps is an operational framework for continuous deployment. Typically used with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), the definitions are managed with Git workflows, providing a version history and an audit trail. Automatic reconciliation compares the desired state, stored in Git, with the actual runtime state and applies changes as required. Weave GitOps is a continuous delivery product to run your applications in any Kubernetes. That was easy. all provide log ingestion capabilities.
