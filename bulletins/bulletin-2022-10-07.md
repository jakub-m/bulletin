There are many best practices for maintaining backward and forward compatibility in application code, but it&#39;s not very commonly mentioned in relation to SQL. SQL is used to produce critical business information for applications and decision-making, so there&#39;s no reason it shouldn&#39;t benefit from similar practices. In this article, I present a simple way to future-proof SQL.

I recently noticed Scirge advertising itself to corporations, promising to “solve” data leaks. Reason enough to take a look into how they do it. Turns out: by pushing a browser extension to all company employees which could be misused as spyware. Worse yet, it obfuscates data streams, making sure that employees cannot see what data is being collected. Each company is provided with their individual build of the Scirge extension, configured with the company’s individual Scirge backend.crx .

One of the four fundamental features of transactional databases is durability. It says that once a transaction is committed, the stored data remains available even if the database crashes. If we upload some information into the database, we must be able to read it later, no matter what happens. It is so elementary that we frequently don’t even think about it: if we save a record with the ’42’ value in a database, we will get ’42’ every time we read that record, until the next modification.g.g.

DevOps revolves around the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the generation and release of product artifacts as part of the overall development process pipeline. This increases production efficiency and minimizes time to market, critical factors in an agile development environment. The quality and dependability of these artifacts directly depend on the pipeline&#39;s integrity. Therefore, the pipeline must be secure if the product is to be secure.

They showed a new mode (called &#34;generate&#34;) added to the TLA&#43; checker to enable  obtaining statistical properties from the models. Here is how this works in a nutshell.

… But if you must, we made something that can help you do it right. The folks at bit.io just published an excellent review of PostgreSQL security , with a startling conclusion: the vast majority of PostgreSQL connections that are happening over the public internet are insecure, due to a combination of server misconfigurations and most clients unfortunately defaulting to unsafe settings. You might think that a MitM is hard to pull off, so it’s not that bad. Turns out, that’s fairly difficult.

It’s the monad is a burrito gag except you actually pick something where the analogy is helpful. This seems especially effective with concurrency topics.

The problem with Scrum is that it usually works. In tech, we hate that. What we like is to give talks, prepare slide decks, and, most importantly, to invent things ourselves. Just like creating your own front-end framework is a rite of passage for web developers, creating your own version of Scrum is a rite of passage for engineering managers. Both cases usually result in catastrophic failure, followed by tears and despair. This post’s structure is simple. Estimations I love estimations.com .

Why did you choose Scrum instead of Kanban? If you can’t answer that question, you didn’t choose Scrum. Someone else chose it for you. Even in the rare case people can answer this question, they reveal their deep misunderstanding of Kanban by mentioning one or more of these reasons: Scrum makes teams more responsive Scrum makes estimations easier Scrum makes work visible Scrum reduces waste Scrum creates cadenced meetings All of the reasons above apply to Kanban as much as they apply to Scrum.

Kubernetes is also a cluster manager, which means that it can manage multiple hosts or VMs on your behalf so you don’t have to worry about them (or their resources) going down.

On today&#39;s Tech Bytes podcast we talk with sponsor Juniper Networks about its AI-driven SD-WAN. While SD-WAN solves a number of problems for network engineers, it also introduces new ones: more site links, more link types, more paths, more ISPs, and more apps, all of which means more data. The Mist AI integration with SD-WAN looks for network anomalies that could lead to problems, and can often fix those problems automatically.
