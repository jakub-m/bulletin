Project timeframes Use broad date ranges as project start and target dates instead of specific ones. This lets you plan project timelines at your current level of certainty, such as next month, quarter, or year, when they more accurately reflect product timelines. Plan ahead by selecting more flexible target dates Filter your view to just the timeframe that matters (e.g. Q2 projects) See roadmaps in different time resolutions (e.g.g.

## [What is Scalability Anyway?](http://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/01/18/scalability.html)


What is Scalability Anyway? Do words mean things? Why? What does scalable mean? As systems designers, builders, and researchers, we use that word a lot. We kind of all use it to mean that same thing, but not super consistently. Some include scaling both up and down, some just up, and some just down. Some include both scaling on a box ( vertical ) and across boxes ( horizontal ), some just across boxes. Some include big rack-level systems, some don’t. I’ve written about this effect before .

## [The Scary Thing About Automating Deploys](https://slack.engineering/the-scary-thing-about-automating-deploys/)


Most of Slack runs on a monolithic service simply called “The Webapp”. It’s big – hundreds of developers create hundreds of changes every week. Deploying at this scale is a unique challenge. When people talk about continuous deployment, they’re often thinking about deploying to systems as soon as changes are ready. They talk about microservices […] The post The Scary Thing About Automating Deploys appeared first on Slack Engineering .

Each January, I try to clean up around the office. This includes getting old papers off my desk and emptying my email box. Similarly, I&#39;m reviewing my long-running research projects. Between FotoForensics and my honeypots, my servers are constantly running a wide range of research projects: Some of these research projects have been short-lived. For example, I was seeing a bunch of images with an unknown EXIF tag identified as &#34;0x9999&#34;.72 , ExifTool decodes the field.php HTTP/1.huawei.0.0.acer...

## [A 2024 Plea for Lean Software (with running code)](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/a-2024-plea-for-lean-software/)


This post is dedicated to the memory of Niklaus Wirth, a computing pioneer who passed away January 1st. In 1995 he wrote an influential article called “A Plea for Lean Software”, and in what follows, I try to make the same case nearly 30 years later, updated for today’s computing horrors. The really short version: the way we build/ship software these days is mostly ridiculous, leading to 350MB packages that draw graphs, and simple products importing 1600 dependencies of unknown provenance.

Trifecta is actual stand-alone software that you can use to paste and drag images to, for easy sharing. It has pained me for years that I had to use imgur for this purpose. Not only does imgur install lots of cookies and trackers on my browser, I also then force these onto the people that visit the images that I share. I checked out some existing solutions you could download, but I worry about their security.

Apple is protecting its App Store racket with the same kind of indignant entitlement that characterized Microsoft during its darkest monopoly days . They’re in full “cut off the air supply” mode in Cupertino, pursuing Epic for a $73m legal bill in a lawsuit they partially lost. But the red mist of vindictiveness is blinding Apple’s view of history, and making them repeat the mistakes it took Microsoft two decades to undo. It’s the ultimate monopoly irony too. And it worked.

Apple just lost an appeal on the ruling from the Epic case that mandated the company allow app developers the right to link to their own websites. And it seems like Apple had been preparing for this outcome, because immediately thereafter, Apple revealed an elaborate bad-faith compliance with the ruling. I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve ever seen this level of arrogance from a major tech monopolist in the history of the computing industry. Bananas.

Computers have gotten so ridiculously fast that there is scarcely any organization in the world that can overwhelm a web-based information system running on a single server. All the complexity and sophistication required to run web services today stem from multi-tenancy. From having a single system serve millions of users at the same time. But what if we stopped doing that? That’s essentially the premise of a resurgent interest in sqlite outside of its historic embedded use cases. It works.

A quarter of a million tech workers were laid off last year from the likes of Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and thousands of other big and small companies in the industry. And it looks like this year is not going to bring any relief. Google just announced more layoffs , Twitch cut 35% of staff , Discord is axing 17% , and Unity is cutting a whopping 25% . It took years to recover from that, and brought some rough years for anyone trying to break into or stay in the industry. Let&#39;s hope so!
