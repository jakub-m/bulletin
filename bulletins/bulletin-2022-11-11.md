By Vadim Filanovsky and Harshad Sane In one of our previous blogposts, A Microscope on Microservices we outlined three broad domains of observability (or “levels of magnification,” as we referred to them) — Fleet-wide, Microservice and Instance. We described the tools and techniques we use to gain insight within each domain. There is, however, a class of problems that requires an even stronger level of magnification going deeper down the stack to introspect CPU microarchitecture.12xl (48 vCPUs).

When you change jobs, ideally you’ll have the opportunity to brief your successor directly. But that isn’t always possible: you might get fired or laid off, you might leave for another job without a clear successor named before your last day, you might have to take sudden medical leave, etc. Situations like that will be disruptive, it’s unavoidable, but a transition file will help minimize that disruption.

I&#39;ve been pondering a hypothesis for a while now. It has to do with the way that groups of people cluster together, particularly when certain topics are involved. This is a simplification for the sake of trying to better understand the things I witness every day. First, there are the actual states you could be in: (A) I understand the situation. (B) I don&#39;t understand the situation. Then there&#39;s the way you are taking it: (1) I accept that I am in whatever state that I am in. Four possibilities.

Mistaking one case for the other causes two of the most common and costly talent retention mistakes: Failing to believe in a rising star, because you thought that their weaknesses couldn’t be addressed. What it looks like: “I always knew they were talented but inexperienced, but I can’t believe how successful they’ve become.” These problems are avoidable. Let’s discuss what to look for and what to do. “You’re not an engineer.

To ensure your Samsung device is up-to-date under settings you can check that your device is running SMR Mar-2021 or later. As defenders, in-the-wild exploit samples give us important insight into what attackers are really doing. These exploits were likely discovered in the testing phase.14.14.server.

Building a complex web platform can be a real challenge, especially when parts of it are delivered by independent teams. Picking out the correct architecture is crucial, but maintaining it can be even more challenging. Frontend microservices, aka microfrontends, is an architecture that gives a lot of flexibility, but can cause performance issues in the future, if not managed well. Introduction It’s 2022. The idea of delivering frontend components in vanilla JS seems to be pointless.

In that post I left out “how to generate and parse DNS queries” because I thought it was boring, but a few people pointed out that they did not know how to parse and generate DNS queries and they were interested in how to do it.

## [Strategy Success: How to Communicate Your Gameplan](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu)


As Professor  Jesper Sørensen  sees it, a winning strategy is the result of conversations, not commands. Sørensen says strategy can be directed from the C-suite, but it doesn’t have to be. “Lots of great strategies are discovered,” he says, “they&#39;re discovered because the leaders were able to listen to their frontline workers or their frontline managers.” A more iterative approach, says Sørensen, helps companies adapt their strategy to an ever-changing landscape.

Twitter, Lyft, Stripe and several other companies had major layoffs last week, and with the undeniable tragedy of layoffs, a frequent debate has reemerged. Are the tech employees working hard enough? Is working hard a sign of puritanical virtue? Are long hours a sign of inefficient production that ignores a century of productivity research? Unless you place a premium on social networking engagement, participating in these debates isn’t very rewarding.

A few weeks ago I bought a piano. It’s a digital piano, which I’m quite excited about for a few reasons: I remain haunted by forgetting to water our piano as a child, it was a ninety pound package that I could install myself rather than a standard piano’s seven hundred pound stature, and most importantly it actually fit in the available nook. One motivation was that our son loves music. If you put him near a piano he will bang on, and on, and on. Playing it creates new energy for me.

Every explanation is a simplification. There are many ways to understand how containers work, but most useful explanations are actually simplifications. Many people have settled on explaining containers by calling them ‘light-weight VMs’ and they are light-weight because they ‘share the kernel with the host’. This is useful, but it simplifies a lot away. But for me, containers are just chrooted processes. But, let me show you why I think chroot 1 is the key.253 # Redis version=7.0._ _.-``__ &#39;&#39;-.
