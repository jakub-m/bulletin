An early draft of Probably Overthinking It included two chapters about probability. I still think they are interesting, but the other chapters are really about data, and the examples in these chapters are more like brain teasers — so I’ve saved them for another book. Here’s an excerpt from the chapter on Bayes theorem. In 1889 Joseph Bertrand posed and solved one of the oldest paradoxes in probability. But his solution is not quite correct – it is right for...

A few weeks ago, I was having dinner with my in-laws, when my grandfather-in-law came marching over. I knew something was wrong. Mind you, he is not a complainer. He has a remarkable story. Born in Milwaukee. Military veteran. Worked in a meat-packing plant. Got into law school. Moved to California to teach at Stanford and practice law. Needless to say, when he has a problem, we listen. “I have a real conundrum. The SF Chronicle stopped including the baseball scores in the daily paper.”

Key-value stores have simple semantics which make it cumbersome to perform complex operations involving multiple keys. Redis addresses this by providing low latency access to complex data structures like lists, sets, and hashes . Unfortunately, Redis lacks strong consistency guarantees and durability in the face of node failures, which limits its applicability beyond caching use cases.99% availability, and strong consistency in the face of failures.

Programmers are often skeptical of aesthetics because they frequently associate it with veneering. A thin sheen of flashy marketing design covering up for a rotten or deficient product. Something that looks good from afar, but reveals itself to be a disappointing imitation up close. They&#39;re right to be skeptical. Cheap veneers are the worst. But discarding the value of aesthetic on behalf of cheap imitations is a mistake. Making something beautiful takes extra steps. It&#39;s motivation.

## [System tests have failed](https://world.hey.com/dhh/system-tests-have-failed-d90af718)


When we introduced a default setup for system tests in Rails 5.1 back in 2016, I had high hopes. In theory, system tests, which drive a headless browser through your actual interface, offer greater confidence that the entire machine is working as it ought. And because it runs in a black-box fashion, it should be more resilient to implementation changes. But I&#39;m sad to report that I have not found any of this to be true in practice. I&#39;m sure there are many reasons for this state of malaise.

I&#39;ve never seen so much paranoia in technology about missing out on The Next Big Thing as with AI. Companies seem less excited about the prospects than they are petrified that its going to kill them. Maybe that fear is justified, maybe it&#39;s not, but what&#39;s incontestable is the kind of desperation it&#39;s leading to. Case in point: Slack. So Salesforce just announced that they&#39;ll be training their Slack AI models on people&#39;s private messages, files, and other content .com . But I digress. Buckle up!

Carta harnesses the power of a small group of senior engineers called navigators to bridge the gap between global strategy and local decision-making, using a written engineering strategy. Navigators replace a need for consensus and boost velocity by combining technical context, domain context, strategic alignment, and judgment to make engineering decisions quickly.

## [How to Create and Remove a Virtual Environment with conda](https://earthly.dev/blog/conda-virtual-env/)


Python is one of the most ubiquitous programming languages today, and because of its history and popularity, a lot of tooling has been created over the years to help Python developers achieve their goals. One of these tools is virtual environments. Python virtual environments are an effective way to avoid dependency conflicts between different Python projects because they allow you to install various versions of the same package dependency in different projects.02-1-Linux-x86_64.1.yml file.

Managing multiple Python versions and dependencies across different projects can be challenging. Virtual environments solve this problem by allowing developers to isolate project dependencies. With virtual environments, you can create sandboxed systems where you can install project-specific dependencies without affecting the entire system-wide Python installation. In this article, you’ll learn a little more about virtual environments and how to create and use them in Python with Miniconda .4.9.

You don’t have to do anything to get it to work, and that will always be the case. But you don’t have to stop there. Optimizing the structure of your Earthfile can often improve baseline caching and increase speed even more.

However, managing dependencies within a Python application can quickly become complicated, necessitating compatibility checks across various Python versions, resolution of dependency conflicts, and negotiation of platform-specific requirements. What Is PyInstaller? PyInstaller supports Python version 3. You can use the numpy Python package to generate a random number.5.9.

As your application scales, manually managing these environments becomes cumbersome.pythonhosted.
