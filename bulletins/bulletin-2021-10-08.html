                        On November 20, 2020 Docker began rate limiting requests to its popular Docker Hub registry. This change applied to all users, anonymous or free. When this change was applied, developer workflows around the world screeched to a halt. Many were just fine after simply logging in (the rate limit is higher for logged-in accounts), but others found themselves needing to pay for a service account . Depending on usage, service accounts don’t come cheap. For others, reality might not be quite so plush..

                        Go is well-known for having great tooling for analyzing code written in the language, right in the standard library with the go/* packages ( go/parser , go/ast , go/types etc.); in addition, the golang.org/x/tools module contains several supplemental packages that are even more powerful. I&#39;ve used one of these packages to describe how to write multi-package analysis tools in a post from last year . Finally, I&#39;ll discuss the limitations of this approach and the golang. First, we&#39;ll discuss ast.g.

Based on a claim by (I think) Jess Kerr , who said something like “In domain-driven design, you’re supposed to start with concrete examples, because those flush out the edge cases of your problem domain.” And you know what’s the best edge case? Jews. These commandments are all fixed in a single, unchanging holy text, the Torah . My oven has a safety limit.

                        Distributed/networked systems employ data replication to achieve availability and scalability. Consistency is concerned with the question of what should happen if a client modifies some data items and concurrently another client reads or modifies the same items possibly at a different replica. Linearizability is a strong form of consistency. (That is why it is also called as strong-consistency.e.   Linearizability (i.e. Examples I will use the same color to match request response pairs.

At Netflix, we have significant investments in ensuring new versions of our applications are well tested. However, Netflix is available for streaming on thousands of types of devices and it is powered by hundreds of micro-services which are deployed independently, making it extremely challenging to comprehensively test internally.

                        There are lots of challenges in being public while trying to innovate, and limits to being a private company as well; but it’s rare to see a company go public then private then back to public again. As is the case with Dell Technologies, one of the largest tech companies — which went private 2012-2013 and...

                        Last year, during lockdown, many discovered the importance of PDF forms when having to deal remotely with administrations and large organizations like banks. Firefox supported displaying PDF forms, but it didn’t support filling them: users had to print them, fill them by hand, and scan them back to digital form. We decided it was time to reinvest in the PDF viewer (PDF.js) and support filling PDF forms within Firefox to make our users&#39; lives easier.

Mozilla Rally puts you in control of your data while building a better Internet and a better society.

                        Starting with Firefox 93, Firefox will monitor available system memory and, should it ever become so critically low that a crash is imminent, Firefox will respond by unloading memory-heavy but not actively used tabs. This feature is currently enabled on Windows and will be deployed later for macOS and Linux as well. The post Tab Unloading in Firefox 93 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog .

Devs often tell stories of things that prevent them from working quickly and efficiently. Many involve frustrating interactions with sys admins, SREs, or DevOps colleagues. One story I have heard several times involves a conversation like this: dev: Hey, SRE team. My build is failing and I don’t know what’s happening with the app in the build node. Sorry. I might as well be guessing.10.10.1.27.

                        Kotlin is one of the most versatile programming languages available, in large part because of the Kotlin team’s focus on bringing it to as many platforms as possible. It is the primary language for developing Android applications and is popular for JVM backends. Kotlin also features targets for native binary compilation with Kotlin/Native, and for web through Kotlin/JS. One of its most promising features is the ability to target multiple platforms it compiles to. version: 2.0.4.apple.dt.8.8.8.8.

                        Modern software development increasingly relies on distributed , service-based architectural patterns to achieve scalability, reliability, and rapid build, test, and release cycles. Two of the most popular service-based approaches are service-oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices . In this article, we will examine both approaches to identify their similarities and differences as well as some use cases for each. Let’s start by getting a feel for what SOA really is.

With a few lines of code, you can bring the amazing world of continuous delivery to your project and increase the reliability of the whole process while freeing up some of your time.

But although I worked across a wide range of tools — Jupyter/Python, tidyverse, superset, internal tools, even Java UDFs — the bulk of this work was actually done in SQL. It’s doing the work again next week.e.ai .

In the previous blog , we discussed a methodology for assessing the probability of technical success — P(T). The aim was to use objective criteria and a mathematical formulation to derive the probability that a data science or AI prototype will succeed. The resulting number guides the decision to either activate or abandon the prototype phase of the project. This presents a challenge. Take the average.

Unlike typical software development, the results of training depend on both the training code and the input data. This can make debugging a training job a complex process, even when you’re running it on your local machine. Running code on remote infrastructure can make this task even more difficult. Also, training jobs can get stuck and stop making progress without visible logs or metrics.distribute.  3.

Scaling for a global market needs successful cloud-native delivery, cutting-edge management tools, and new approaches that can efficiently handle distributed, hybrid, and even multi-cloud environments.  Successful Hybrid/Multi/distributed applications provide their maintainers with observability , repeatability , and autonomy .

                        When you’re migrating to BigQuery, you have a rich library of BigQuery native functions available to empower your analytics workloads. You can also extend this existing set of functions with your own user-defined functions (UDFs). Because we’re human and we all make mistakes, it’s a good idea to write unit tests to validate that your UDFs are behaving correctly. Dataform’s command line tool solves this need, enabling you to programmatically execute unit tests for all your UDFs. (Recommended). 4.

                        In software engineering, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are two very important concepts. CI is when you integrate changes (new features, approved code commits, etc.) into your system reliably and continuously. CD is when you deploy these changes reliably and continuously. CI and CD both can be performed in isolation as well as they can be coupled.  A machine learning (ML) system is essentially a software system.
