On December 7, 2021, Google announced it had sued two Russian men allegedly responsible for operating the Glupteba botnet, a global malware menace that has infected millions of computers over the past decade. That same day, AWM Proxy -- a 14-year-old anonymity service that rents hacked PCs to cybercriminals -- suddenly went offline. Security experts had long seen a link between Glupteba and AWM Proxy, but new research shows AWM Proxy&#39;s founder is one of the men being sued by Google.

## [Notes on running containers with bubblewrap](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/06/28/some-notes-on-bubblewrap/)


Hello! About a year ago I got mad about Docker container startup time. This was because I was building an nginx playground where I was starting a new “container” on every HTTP request, and so for it to feel reasonably snappy, nginx needed to start quickly. Also, I was running this project on a pretty small cloud machine (256MB RAM), a small CPU, so I really wanted to avoid unnecessary overhead. you should definitely not take security advice from me. For both Docker and Podman, it’s about 300ms..

Certainly one of the main distinguishing features of the Java world is the Garbage Collector. Using it is safe and convenient, it allows us to forget about many tedious responsibilities, letting us focus on the pure joy of coding. Yet sometimes it can cause a headache too, especially when we notice that GC uses our resources too intensively. It turns out that it is possible. Comfort comes at a price At Allegro we are very keen on metrics. This area can be accessed using a simple API.2 and 3.

As part of our work to ensure a free and open web, we&#39;ve been working together with Ecma International, and many partners to write a License inspired by the W3C Document and Software License. Our goal was that JavaScript’s status would align with other specifications of the Web. In addition, with this new license available to all TCs at Ecma International, this will provide other organizations to approach standardization with the same perspective.

Posted by Dan Walker and Dan Liebling, Software Engineers, Google Research People don’t write in the same way that they speak. Written language is controlled and deliberate, whereas transcripts of spontaneous speech (like interviews) are hard to read because speech is disorganized and less fluent. One aspect that makes speech transcripts particularly difficult to read is disfluency , which includes self-corrections, repetitions, and filled pauses (e.g., words like “ umm ”, and “ you know” ).e.

Continuous integration/continuous delivery ( CI/CD ) principles offer multiple benefits to software organizations, including faster time to market, higher-quality code, and simpler and faster fault isolation. Applications built using CI/CD pipeline best practices tend to see a huge increase in users over time, necessitating a migration from a large codebase and low-scalability monolithic architecture to a more manageable and efficient microservice architecture. This is where Tekton comes in.23.

Many Continuous Integration (CI) tools claim to do GitOps but what they actually do is Continuous Deployment (CD). Continuous Deployment is not GitOps but GitOps does provide Continuous Deployment and so much more. If you want to do true GitOps, do you have to deprecate all the work you’ve done building out your CI tooling? Read on to find out. CD is not GitOps Continuous Deployment (CD) is not GitOps. To be true GitOps the following principles as defined by OpenGitOps must be followed.

On Google Cloud, one of the ways an organization may want to enforce fairness in how much of a resource can be consumed is through the use of quotas . Limiting resource consumption on services is one way that companies can better manage their cloud costs. Oftentimes, people associate quotas with APIs to access that said resource. This is where fairness comes into play. It allows people to put limits that can be scoped per user or per customer and allows them to increase or lower those limits.g.
