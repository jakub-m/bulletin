## [Why browser extension games need access to all websites](https://palant.info/2023/06/14/why-browser-extension-games-need-access-to-all-websites/)


When installing browser extensions in Google Chrome, you are asked to confirm the extension’s permissions. In theory, this is supposed to allow assessing the risk associated with an extension. In reality however, users typically lack the knowledge to properly interpret this prompt. For example, I’ve often seen users accusing extension developers of spying just because the prompt says they could . On the other hand, people will often accept these cryptic prompts without thinking twice. storage .

Sinds een tijdje maak ik grafiekjes van hoe Nederland aan z’n elektriciteit komt. En soms ben ik daar dan enthousiast over, zeker als de wind waait en de zon goed schijnt.

With interest rates being what they are, I&#39;m thinking about debt differently. When rates were low, I was pretty pro fixed-rate debt, as long as that rate &lt;3.5%. But nowadays, it&#39;s time value of money is a much more significant effect. This has come up for me because I&#39;m considering installing solar on my house, but the financing options make it much more difficult to try to analyze the many different ways to go about it. The main point of going solar would be to liberate cash from day 1 onward.

Almost immediately, I received inquiries about the photos in the indictment and the PDF document. I&#39;m going to address most of these inquiries, but I&#39;m not going to opine on the political, legality, or criminality around the indictment and legal process. I&#39;m strictly looking at the PDFs and pictures. It was covered by almost every major news outlet.gov) web site.

Abilities unused will atrophy, so putting in anything less than your best means giving up on what you’re capable of. You can’t save talent or energy for better days, only watch it go to waste. This is a hard truth to accept if you don’t think your company has earned your best. And companies make employees feel like that all the time. This is part of what drives the whole “act your wage” rebellion. The years will wash away quickly. You let it slip. That’s a tragedy. Not for them, but for you.

By Jennifer Shin , Tejas Shikhare , Will Emmanuel In 2022, a major change was made to Netflix’s iOS and Android applications. We migrated Netflix’s mobile apps to GraphQL with zero downtime, which involved a total overhaul from the client to the API layer. Until recently, an internal API framework, Falcor , powered our mobile apps. They are now backed by Federated GraphQL , a distributed approach to APIs where domain teams can independently manage and own specific sections of the API.

Data classes , introduced in Python 3.7, provide a convenient way to define classes that are a collection of fields. But for such use cases, named tuples, built into the collections module in the Python standard library, are good choices too. Named tuples have been around since Python 2.6, and several features have been added in the recent Python 3.x releases. To follow along, you need to have Python 3.8 or later version. To run the example on slots, you need Python 3.10. So they are immutable.
