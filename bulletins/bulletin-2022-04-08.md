Unicode works by representing each ‘character’ as a numerical value (called a code point) between 0 and 1 114 112. Thus the character é is typically represented as the numerical value 233 (or 0xe9 in … Continue reading String representations are not unique: learn to normalize!

We’re Adam Hood and Brian Amaratunga—two senior software engineers who joined Dropbox in 2021 as Virtual First employees. This means we spend most of our time working remotely, with physical studios reserved for in-person collaboration. When Dropbox became a Virtual First company in October 2020, it also meant reimagining the onboarding process to ensure new employees still had a high-quality experience—similar to what they would have gotten before in person.com. We were both very impressed.

Merge code every week. That’s what you should be saying to your new Software Engineering hire. Let’s discuss. Managing performance for something like software engineering sucks. Performance management is never fun. But with something like software engineering, it’s particularly difficult. There’s just too many variables.

Recently, a new set of sorting functions has landed in Go&#39;s golang.org/x/exp/slices package [1] . These functions leverage Go generics to provide a more ergonomic API for sorting (without requiring users to implement sort.Interface ), and also deliver a nice performance improvement, as the CL demonstrates. In this post, I&#39;ll dive deep into why these generic functions are faster than the existing ones in the sort package, even though they use precisely the same algorithm and loop structure..... .

## [The journey to build an explainable AI-driven recommendation system to help scale sales efficiency across LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/the-journey-to-build-an-explainable-ai-driven-recommendation-sys)


Co-authors: Jilei Yang, Parvez Ahammmad, Fangfang Tan, Rodrigo Aramayo, Suvendu Jena, Jessica Li At LinkedIn, we have the opportunity to work with many different types of customers with varying business needs. From multinational corporations to small businesses, technology plays such a critical role in how we enable our sales teams to support our customers. These teams need to be well-versed in their customers’ unique needs and the broader macro-environment in which they operate.

## [Leveraging configurable components to scale LinkedIn&#39;s Profile experience](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/leveraging-configurable-components-to-scale-linkedin-s-profile-e)


Background and motivation The Profile lies at the center of LinkedIn’s ecosystem and is the primary tool members use to showcase their professional identity. To meet the growing representational needs of our members, we had to acknowledge some of the challenges that come with building at scale: Customizations based on member intents can be complex, resulting in a one-size fits all Profile. Additions of new content types on Profile are also resource intensive.

## [Observability for GitOps pipelines](https://www.weave.works/blog/observability-for-gitops)


With the growing complexity of modern cloud-native systems, observability is more important than ever. Without it, any Platform Architect or DevOps Engineer would be flying blind. GitOps has provided a set of practices for building and managing development platforms and production Kubernetes clusters. Yet, there is no room for compromise with observability when it comes to a GitOps pipeline. You cannot manage what you cannot see. However, there is a difference between them. 2. 3. 4.

This is similar to how different members of a team have clearly delineated roles and responsibilities. The end goal of GitOps is to enable better automation and greater deployment velocity.

In a DevOps environment, you have to deal with a lot of different internal services that have their own authentication systems. This can take a lot of time and work to provision correctly, especially as part of user onboarding and offboarding. Tailscale already knows who you are , so for tools that you only make internally accessible in your tailnet, such as Grafana (a popular observability/statistics graphing service), we can take advantage of that to lighten the load.ts.127.23.ts.ts.0.0.0.0.0.

Over the past few years I’ve gotten into the unhelpful habit of checking Twitter search to see if folks have mentioned my writing. I don’t actually do anything with that though, beyond perhaps leaving a “like”. I enjoy using Twitter, but this part of how I use Twitter is just an unhelpful habit to waste time, so I wanted to try automating it away. You can see the key pieces at: retrieve.py : script that calls Twitter API, parses it, and write each results to a text file .github/workflows/scrape.

This is an exerpt from Infrastructure Engineer’s section on efficiency . Before diving into the mechanics of managing infrastructure costs, the first question to answer is whether it’s a valuable use of organizational time to make your current infrastructure spend more efficient. How you think about this will vary a bit depending on whether your company is early-stage, prioritizing growth or profitability. You should instead be focused on finding product-market fit for your first product.

Yesterday&#39;s post about &#34;pipefail&#34; also involved some systems which treated an empty file as a valid file. This turns out to be surprisingly common. I think people might be shocked at exactly how much you can get away with, and how many different things will accept such a beast. One of the failure modes I used to see with certain package-based systems at a job with a large number of computers is that sometimes it would just fail to populate it with actual data... and it wouldn&#39;t fail.

Here&#39;s a bash shell scenario for people who like these things. Let&#39;s say you have a script like this: #!/bin/bash reader | writer ... and &#34;reader&#34; fails and yields no data, and then &#34;writer&#34; runs and writes a nice fat blank to the database system. This then causes all kinds of fun times down the road. So, this gets used as an opportunity to write one of those awful corporate outage bulletins which is more about hawking the company&#39;s wares than getting to the bottom of a problem. Seriously.......

This type of testing approach starts from the end user’s perspective and simulates a real-world scenario. End-to-end testing may sound comprehensive, but there are many other testing methods that you should use with it to create a robust continuous integration practice.

Cloud Bigtable is a natural destination for Apache HBase workloads, as it is a fully managed service that is compatible with the HBase API. As a result, many customers running business-critical applications with large-scale data and low-latency needs consider migrating to Bigtable. However, migrating from HBase to Bigtable can still be challenging since you typically have to pause your applications for migration downtime. HBase Bigtable Replication Library minimizes downtime for live migrations.
