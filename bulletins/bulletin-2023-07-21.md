Repls today allow 256&#43; GiB of storage space, up from a historical 1GiB limit. This post is about the infrastructure that enabled that change. Historically Replit limited files in each Repl to 1 GiB of storage space. The 1 GiB limit was enough for small projects, but with the advent of AI model development and with some projects needing gigabytes worth of dependencies to be installed, 1 GiB is not enough. HOW REPLS PREVIOUSLY OPERATED All Repls use btrfs as their filesystem of choice.kernel.).

## [F1: A Distributed SQL Database That Scales](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2023/07/f1-distributed-sql-database-that-scales.html)


This is a VLDB 2013 paper (appeared earlier at Sigmod&#39;12 it seems) from Google about paying tech-debt. F1 replaces the sharded MySQL hacky implementation of AdWords with a principled well-engineered infrastructure that builds a distributed SQL layer on top of Spanner. My reaction to this paper probably up until 5 years ago would be &#34;ugh, schemas, database stuff... No distributed algorithms, pass!&#34;. But I like to think that I improve with age. Here are the things I love about this work. 1. 2. 3.

Then I checked out simpy and saw it had a Defense of Design (DoD): This document explains why SimPy is designed the way it is and how its design evolved over time. This is great! More projects need this! All languages and projects do &#34;odd&#34; things that make no sense to outsiders. It&#39;s backwards compatible with something else. Go away and think. — G. K.

I have this belief that all code should be rewritten at least three times. The first version is when you have a sense of the problem, but may not know all of the requirements or corner cases. So, you build &#34;something&#34;. It may not be ideal, but it gives you a basis for evaluating the system, identifying more requirements, and documenting some corner cases. For me, this first version is often programmed in a scripting language like bash or perl. (I hate python . As a result, they find nothing.9%.

Thus most founders begin 🎶Their Journey🎶 sprinting from one pressing problem to the next in rapid succession to achieve their lift off. But reaching escape velocity doesn&#39;t guarantee you&#39;ll keep going, unless you retain the propulsion from an unreasonable sense of urgency. Don&#39;t listen too closely.

We read and treasure every single message you send us this way.

Another interpretability tool for your toolbox Photo by fabio on  Unsplash Knowing how to assess your model is essential for your work as a data scientist. No one will sign off on your solution if you’re not able to fully understand and communicate it to your stakeholders. This is why knowing interpretability methods is so important. The lack of interpretability can kill a very good model. Then, we can use our model to predict our shuffled dataset. Let’s think about it. Looks good for now.
