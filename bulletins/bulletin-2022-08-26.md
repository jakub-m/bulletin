## [Slowing Down to Speed Up – Circuit Breakers for Slack’s CI/CD](https://slack.engineering/circuit-breakers/)


What happens when your distributed service has challenges with stampeding herds of internal requests? How do you prevent cascading failures between internal services? How might you re-architect your workflows when naive horizontal or vertical scaling reaches their respective limits? These were the challenges facing Slack engineers during their day-to-day development workflows in 2020.

I watch my logs like a hawk. (Like a very bored hawk.) Over the last few months, I have been seeing an increase in blind web attacks. This is where an attacker has a long list of potentially vulnerable URLs (e.g., /wp_login.php, /login.action, /shell.php) and they step through each one &#34;just in case&#34; the server might be vulnerable to their exploit. None of these URL paths exist on my servers, but the attackers don&#39;t care. A firewall only has a few options when it receives a packet.94.138.94.138.

## [ Fast Serializable Multi-Version Concurrency Control for Main-Memory Database Systems](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/08/fast-serializable-multi-version.html)


This paper from Sigmod 2015 describes the addition of Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to the Hyper database, and discusses at length how they implement serializability efficiently with little overhead compared to snapshot isolation. Coming only two years later, this paper seems like a response/one-up-manship to the Hekaton paper . In the paper, you can see at many places statements like &#34;in constrast to/ unlike/ as in/ Hekaton&#34; phrase. Hyper is also an in-memory database as in Hekaton..

Our new Message Interactions feature makes it very easy to interact with messages previously sent to a channel. This comes in handy if you’re building chat functionality where users interact with a previous message – for example by ‘liking’, replying, quoting, or adding an emoji reaction.

TL;DR The software development life cycle (SDLC) has always been followed by functional testing to ensure software solutions have all the necessary features and functions. Because of the growing number of cyberattacks, software development stakeholders have been forced to implement security testing as the main track in SDLC to prevent vulnerabilities and flaws in applications [...

## [Catching sanitizer errors programmatically](https://lemire.me/blog/2022/08/20/catching-sanitizer-errors-programmatically/)


The C and C&#43;&#43; languages offer little protection against programmer errors. Errors do not always show up where you expect. You can silently corrupt the content of your memory. It can make bugs difficult to track. To solve this problem, I am a big fan of programming in C and C&#43;&#43; using sanitizers. They slow your … Continue reading Catching sanitizer errors programmatically

## [Attack surface of extension pages](https://palant.info/2022/08/24/attack-surface-of-extension-pages/)


In the previous article we discussed extension privileges . And as we know from another article , extension pages are the extension context with full access to these privileges. So if someone were to attack a browser extension, attempting Remote Code Execution (RCE) in an extension page would be the obvious thing to do. In this article we’ll make some changes to the example extension to make such an attack against it feasible. createElement ( &#34;div&#34; ); div . innerHTML = untrustedData ; document .

## [Ephemeral nodes… now more ephemeral!](https://tailscale.com/blog/ephemeral-logout/)


If you’re using Tailscale with short-lived devices such as containers or frequently redeployed infrastructure, you are probably already using ephemeral nodes . Ephemeral nodes are meant for automated, frequently redeployed workloads because they’re automatically removed from your network once they are no longer active. However, this automatic process could potentially take an hour or longer while the coordination server waits to see if the ephemeral node will come back online. Starting in v1.

by Ehtsham Elahi with James McInerney , Nathan Kallus , Dario Garcia Garcia and Justin Basilico Introduction This writeup is about using reinforcement learning to construct an optimal list of recommendations when the user has a finite time budget to make a decision from the list of recommendations. Working within the time budget introduces an extra resource constraint for the recommender system. It is similar to many other decision problems (for e.g.g.g.). This is known as the SARSA algorithm.

The concept of a hybrid cloud is gaining prominence as it helps organizations save costs, improve agility, better scale development, and utilize applications and tools from a variety of vendors. However, it comes at the cost of potential security threats. Almost 94% of enterprises are concerned about cloud security, according to the 2022 Cloud Security Report .

Let&#39;s assume you&#39;re familiar with basic SQL databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, and document databases like MongoDB and Elasticsearch. You probably know Redis too. But you&#39;re hearing more and more about embedded key-value stores like RocksDB , LevelDB , PebbleDB , and so on. And you&#39;re hearing about distributed key-value databases like FoundationDB and TiKV . What&#39;s the big deal? Aren&#39;t these just the equivalent of Redis or Java&#39;s ConcurrentHashMap? Let&#39;s take a look. And so on.g.g. It is not.
