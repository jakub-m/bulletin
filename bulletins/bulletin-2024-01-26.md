Pat’s Big Deal, and Transaction Coordination Working together towards a common goal. MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [[&#39;$&#39;, &#39;$&#39;], [&#39;\\(&#39;, &#39;\\)&#39;]]} }; I have a lot of opinions about Pat Helland’s CIDR’24 paper Scalable OLTP in the Cloud: What’s the BIG DEAL? 1 . Most importantly, I like the BIG DEAL that he proposes: Scalable apps don’t concurrently update the same key. Scalable DBs don’t coordinate across disjoint TXs updating different keys. Tens, at least.e.e. between $\tau^A_s$ and $\tau^A_c$).

For better or (more likely) worse, this is definitely looking like the year of AI. For example: Over the last six months at FotoForensics , I&#39;ve been seeing a significant increase in pictures that have been altered by AI. (My impression is that the problem will get a lot worse before it gets better.) On Etsy, handmade item sellers are noticing a significant slump in sales. The new AI system appears to favor stock photos and templates. ... Before the first break, they had over 660 attendees...

Last Summer I published an Estonian Travel Guide aimed towards visitors making a first-time, 3-day journey.

I aimed to make the PDF small so that it could be downloaded on an unreliable internet connection and could be easily read off of a mobile phone.

In some cases you’re worried the company could literally collapse. It’s bad. Do not do that. Ever.

Google continues to struggle with cybercriminals running malicious ads on its search platform to trick people into downloading booby-trapped copies of popular free software applications. The malicious ads, which appear above organic search results and often precede links to legitimate sources of the same software, can make searching for software on Google a dicey affair.

A Canadian man who says he&#39;s been falsely charged with orchestrating a complex e-commerce scam is seeking to clear his name. His case appears to involve &#34;triangulation fraud,&#34; which occurs when a consumer purchases something online -- from a seller on Amazon or eBay, for example -- but the seller doesn&#39;t actually own the item for sale. Instead, the seller purchases the item from an online retailer using stolen payment card data.

The past couple weeks I’ve been working on three semi-related articles that I think of as the “High Context Triad.” Those are Layers of context , Navigating ambiguity , and Tradeoffs are multi-dimensional . One of my background projects, probably happening in 2025 or 2026 after I’ve finished my nascent project on engineering strategy , is publishing a second edition of Staff Engineer , and I intended these three articles as supplements. Eventually.

## [Useful tradeoffs are multi-dimensional.](https://lethain.com/multi-dimensional-tradeoffs/)


In some pockets of the industry, an axiom of software development is that deploying software quickly is at odds with thoroughly testing that software. One reason that teams believe this is because a fully automated deployment process implies that there’s no opportunity for manual quality assurance. Introducing that dimension makes it possible for engineers to get fast, predictable deployments and for quality assurance to get the chance to review before enabling the feature for users.

Perceiving the layers of context in problems will unlock another stage of career progression as a Staff-plus engineer, but there’s at least one essential skill to develop afterwards: navigating ambiguity. In my experience, navigating deeply ambiguous problems is the rarest skill in engineers, and doing it well is a rarity. One scenario was that many countries would require domestic transactions (e.g.” If the requirements were ambiguous, so were our tools for solving it.g.g.g.

Juniors are judged on effort, seniors are judged on outcomes. That’s a common and useful heuristic for evaluating employees. It neatly separates productivity from effectiveness, and places a premium on the latter. But the biggest benefit of this distinction ought to be of the second order: Increased bandwidth. With junior people, you not only owe them frequent feedback to aid their advancement, but it’s a prerequisite to getting what you want out of the work. Which brings me to senior employees.

The human brain infers object depths by comparing the pictures captured by left and right eyes at the same time and interpreting the disparities.cs.Dataset.

Large language models have been around for several years, but it wasn’t until 2023 that their presence became truly ubiquitous both within and outside machine learning communities. Previously opaque concepts like fine-tuning and RAG have gone mainstream, and companies big and small have been either building or integrating LLM-powered tools into their workflows. Wenqi Glantz walks us through the process of quantizing the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.

## [A How-To Guide on Acquiring AI Systems](https://spectrum.ieee.org/guide-on-acquiring-ai-systems)


International Data Corp. estimated that US $118 billion was spent globally in 2022 to purchase artificial intelligence hardware, software, and data services. IDC has predicted the figure will nearly triple, to $300 billion, by 2026. But public procurement systems are not ready for the challenges of procuring AI systems, which bring with them new risks to citizens. To help address this challenge IEEE Standards Association has introduced a pioneering standard for AI procurement.S.

## [That Awesome Robot Demo Could Have a Human in the Loop](https://spectrum.ieee.org/robot-teleoperation-autonomy)


Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen a couple of high-profile videos of robotic systems doing really impressive things. This is a problem that’s not unique to the folks behind either of the videos above; it’s a communication issue that the entire robotics community struggles with. But as robots (and robot videos) become more mainstream, it’s important that we get better at it. Why use teleoperation? Humans are way, way, way, way, way better than robots at almost everything.g. This takes time.

In work and in life, it’s easy to get stuck in your ways. That’s why Manan Suri has always looked to expand his horizons both professionally and personally. Growing up in India, he was used to transitions and new experiences because his family frequently moved around the country as his father relocated for his job as a chemical engineer. Traveling stuck with Suri in adulthood. He studied and worked in Dubai, the United States, France, and Belgium over the course of his twenties.D.Y.D.D.”

One of the knocks on the potential of electric vehicles has been the paucity of charging stations compared with the near-ubiquitous presence of gas stations. The standard question posed by EV naysayers is, “What if an EV’s battery is nearly depleted and the nearest charging station is too far to reach?” BT Group, Britain’s largest telecom service provider, has stepped forward with an idea that could ensure EVs are virtually always within range of a charger.K. government.K.

The shipping industry has been trying to cut its carbon emissions for years, and with little to show for it. Nearly all of the world’s ship fleet still runs on diesel fuel, with about a quarter of new ships on order being built to run on somewhat lower-carbon alternatives like liquefied natural gas, methanol, or hybrid propulsion. The industry now faces serious pressure to pick up the pace. At a July meeting of the International Maritime Organization , the U.N.S. The U.S. Nuclear reactors for U.
