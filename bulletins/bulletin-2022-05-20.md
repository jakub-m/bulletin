## [Codebases as communication](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/codebases-as-communication/)


Conventionally we communicate programming ideas with talks, papers, and blog posts. But we can also communicate ideas with entire codebases. If someone finds a security exploit, she’ll sometimes publish a proof of concept to prove the exploit isn’t just theoretical. Now let’s say the exploit PoC comes with a ton of command-line flags: verbose mode, configuration options, output formats, the whole works. This makes codebases like any other kind of communication medium. Platform a technique.

A good password manager should be able to securely store, sync, and even autofill your username and password when logging into websites and apps. A password manager like… Dropbox Passwords ! When we released Dropbox Passwords in the Summer of 2020, it was important we ensured that a user’s logins would always be available—and up to date—on any device they used. Eventually we found a solution that built on prior Dropbox syncing work. Initially, our sync algorithm used a two-way merge.

I recently got an email about moving into an engineering management role too early in the email writer’s career: I became an engineering manager two years ago, which was also two years into my career. The reason is mainly that we were a small team and when the time came to add line management I was around and down for it. I was quite successful at this job and well recognized in the company. If you’re successful as a manager, it can be difficult to move back without slowing down your career.

What is CockroachDB under the hood? Take a look at its go.mod and notice a number of dependencies that do a lot of work: a PostgreSQL wire protocol implementation , a storage layer , a Raft implementation for distributed consensus . And not part of go.mod but still building on 3rd party code, PostgreSQL&#39;s grammar definition . To be absurdly reductionist, CockroachDB is just the glue around these libraries. All nodes will contain the same data.0.0.1 -p 6000 psql (13.4, server 0.0.0.0.4, server 0.

Disclosure: I hold short positions in companies mentioned in this article. This is not financial advice. Six months ago, I wrote: [Bitcoin] miners burn an enormous amount of capital just to capture the same slice of a diminishing pie, but they take advantage of investor confusion over how mining works to frame it as investing in growth. I want to go deeper on that idea. But first, some accounting.

There are various ways in software to handle error conditions. In C or Go, one returns error code. Other programming languages like C&#43;&#43; or Java prefer to throw exceptions. One benefit of using exceptions is that it keeps your code mostly clean since the error-handling code is often separate. It is debatable whether handling exceptions … Continue reading Avoid exception throwing in performance-sensitive code

GitOps is an operational software development framework that enables organizations to manage IT infrastructure using Git and deliver software applications efficiently. It is an evolution of DevOps that combines Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and DevOps best practices for designing a model that can instantly reproduce the system’s cloud infrastructure and manage architecture based on the state of Git repositories. It can be daunting. This will help both teams work together seamlessly.

Posted by Aurelien Boffy, Senior Staff Software Engineer, and Roberto Pieraccini, Engineering Director, Google Assistant When people converse with one another, context and references play a critical role in driving their conversation more efficiently. For instance, if one asks the question “Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?” and, after receiving an answer, asks “Where was he born?”, it is clear that ‘he’ is referring to William Shakespeare without the need to explicitly mention him.g.e.e.

Some of more tech-savvy Democrats in the U.S. Senate are asking the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate identity-proofing company ID.me for &#34;deceptive statements&#34; the company and its founder allegedly made over how they handle facial recognition data collected on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service, which until recently required anyone seeking a new IRS account online to provide a live video selfie to ID.me.

Millions of U.S. government employees and contractors have been issued a secure smart ID card that enables physical access to buildings and controlled spaces, and provides access to government computer networks and systems at the cardholder&#39;s appropriate security level. But many government employees aren&#39;t issued an approved card reader device that lets them use these cards at home or remotely, and so turn to low-cost readers they find online. What could go wrong? Here&#39;s one example.

In a single, monolithic repository, also known as a monorepo, you keep all your application and microservice code in the same source code repository (usually Git). Typically, teams split the code of various app components into subfolders and use Git workflow for new features or bug fixes. This approach is natural for most applications or systems developed using a monolithic architecture. This monorepo code typically has a single build pipeline that produces the application executable.
