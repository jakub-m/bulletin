It’s impossible, outside choreographed entertainment, to fight two guys together at once; they’ll kill you; the trick to fighting two is to make sure and put one down for long enough that he’s out of the picture long enough to put the other guy down. - Infinite Jest One of the first things my CEO told me is that things move fast, so you have to get things done as completely as possible and move on to the next thing. However, execution of that sage advice is not easy. Just get the thing done..g.

Hello! The other day I ran a Mastodon poll asking people how confident they were that they understood how HEAD works in Git. The results (out of 1700 votes) were a little surprising to me: 10% “100%” 36% “pretty confident” 39% “somewhat confident?” 15% “literally no idea” I was surprised that people were so unconfident about their understanding – I’d been thinking of HEAD as a pretty straightforward topic. the file .git/HEAD Git has a very important file called .git/HEAD .

The process of onboarding myself has been pretty similar at each company in the last decade, though I think I&#39;ve gotten better at it. The process is of course influenced by the team, and my coworkers have been excellent. Still, I wanted to share my thought process and personal strategies. Avoid, at first, what is always challenging Trickier things at companies are the people, organization, and processes.

Pairing is two people working together to write code, while mobbing is three or more. Pairing has been part of the programming milleau since at least the 90&#39;s (with extreme programming), while mobbing is more of a 10&#39;s thing. I&#39;m going to use them interchangeably from here on out even though they&#39;re not interchangeable, because I think everything I&#39;ll say applies to both. Naysayers claim it slows team velocity down, is emotionally exhausting, and only works with very particular personalities.  ↩

## [The Great Kate Debate](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1025-The-Great-Kate-Debate.html)


I&#39;m not a close follower of the British Royal family or their related dramas. But when a single picture floods my FotoForensics service as people around the world determine whether it is real or fake, well, that gets my attention. This is a small sample of the literally thousands of variants of the image that FotoForensics received on March 10th. While these pictures are visually the same image, they differ by dimensions, compression, cropping, coloring, annotations, and more. Nonsense, sure.g..

Reorgs are disruptive, and nobody really tells you what to do in the wake of one. It’s easy to feel adrift, scared for your future, and uncertain about how to behave. Some of that fear is warranted: your job security probably goes down in the months following a reorg.

They also add TLA&#43; specifications of causal consistency and their checking algorithms, and verify them using the TLC model checker, and discuss how TLA&#43; specification can be related to Jepsen testing. This is a journal paper, so it is long. al.r.t.e.

It can also seep into other forms of communication, policies, and ultimately the entire culture. Just no.

## [The Messy Reality Behind a Silicon Valley Unicorn](https://spectrum.ieee.org/unicorn-startup)


For 19 months, the sociologist Benjamin Shestakofsky embedded himself in an early-stage tech startup to study its organization and culture. The company went on to become one of Silicon Valley’s “unicorns,” valued at over US $1 billion. This article is adapted from an excerpt of the author’s new book, Behind the Startup: How Venture Capital Shapes Work, Innovation, and Inequality (University of California Press, 2024).

Manga has grown in popularity in recent years among young adults. The Japanese comics and graphic novels dominated last year’s Circana BookScan graphic novels sales charts . The IEEE Women in Engineering group decided to use manga’s popularity with young people as a way to encourage girls to consider a career in STEM fields. The competition, which was supported by the IEEE Japan Council and the IEEE New Initiatives Committee , was open to all IEEE members and student members.

When IEEE Spectrum first wrote about Covariant in 2020, it was a new-ish robotics startup looking to apply robotics to warehouse picking at scale through the magic of a single end-to-end neural network. At the time, Covariant was focused on this picking use case, because it represents an application that could provide immediate value—warehouse companies pay Covariant for its robots to pick items in their warehouses. “But we’re now taking it quite a bit further.”

A Hands-on Guide for Practitioners Last summer a non-deep learning method for novel view synthesis has entered the game: 3D Gaussian splattig . It is a method to represent a scene in 3D and to render images in real-time from any viewing direction. Some even say they are replacing NeRFs, the predominant method for novel view synthesis and implicit scene representation at that time. I think that is debatable since NeRFs are much more than image renderers. So, let’s go! Image by Sascha Kirch . Fig.
