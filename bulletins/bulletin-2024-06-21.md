Innovation and disruption aren’t just for organizations. According to Whitney Johnson , we can find new possibilities for personal and professional growth — by disrupting ourselves. As an executive coach, author, and podcaster, Johnson teaches people how to level up their lives and careers through the power of personal disruption. “Personal disruption [is] a process of deliberate self-innovation; a decision to step back from who you are to slingshot into who you can be,” she explains.

Hello all! I’m Carla, a backend engineer at Mercadona Tech. I work in the “Flota” team, where we are creating a system for managing the fleet of delivery trucks we have all across Spain. And, as every other team in Mercadona Tech, we work in pairs — which is what I’m here to talk about. The wonders of pair programming have been proven over and over again by engineering teams; I won’t reiterate all of these. It was during my interview, and I was surprised and excited.

## [Video of Using LLMs in your product.](https://lethain.com/video-mental-model-for-how-to-use-llms-in-products/)


A month ago, I wrote up some notes on using LLMs in your product , and yesterday I got to present an iteration on those notes to the folks at the Sapphire Venture’s 2024 Hypergrowth Engineering Summit . If you’re interested, you can watch a recording of my talk on Youtube . There’s a lot of overlap with the notes, but I also go into Carta’s approach thus-far to incorporating LLMs into our product.

Gen AI Assistants play to the strengths of professionals with a breadth of experience, particularly software developers who can describe what they want the LLM to complete and critically evaluate the result. These tools enable us to swiftly cross divides of domain language and scale large repetitive tasks down to interesting ones on a human scale. By Ken Judy

## [Two ways to use  an LED as a light sensor with Arduino](http://blog.jgc.org/2024/06/two-ways-to-use-led-as-light-sensor.html)


I needed to log when a light switched on and off during the night as part of debugging an oddly behaving movement sensor. To do that I built a really simple light sensor logger using an Arduino Leonardo, a large LED and a resistor or three. Here it is: And here&#39;s the entire Arduino code: void setup() {   Serial.begin(9600);   analogReference(EXTERNAL); } void loop() {   Serial. Then it waits for a second. The LED has a voltage of between about 0mV and 400mV depending on the amount of light.e.

I unearthed a catalogue that I&#39;d picked up in around 1983 of Acorn Computer Systems . This catalogue overlaps the BBC Micro era (which was released in 1981) as it goes up to the final Acorn System 5 (released in 1983). The Acorn Computer Systems were based on the Eurocard format for PCBs that can be mounted in a standard chassis. The Eurocard format meant that you could design a system for your needs, including handling  Prestel /Teletext. And, of course, you could add RAM.

This is a great paper (CACM 2018) by John Ousterhout. Ousterhout is well known for his work on log-structured file system, tcl/tk, Raft, and magic VLSI CAD. His book on Philosophy of Software Design is great, and he has a lot of wisdom about life in general that he shares in his Stanford CS classes. The paper is written very well, so I lift up paragraphs verbatim from it to summarize its main points. There are many war stories in the text. Most common mistakes Mistake 1: Trusting the numbers.

For some time I had been playing with transaction modeling and most recently with replicaset modeling by way of a single log. While playing with these, I realized I can build something cool on top of these building blocks. I just finished building snapshot isolated transaction modeling that sit on top of a replicaset log. This is also a high level approximation of MongoDB-style snapshot isolated transactions on a single replicaset. I put this up on github at  https://github. Here is this commit.

When it comes to observability, we believe open source will win in the end. It’s a sentiment shared by a wide spectrum of users, whether they work in auto manufacturing , banking , or shipping . The U.S. federal government is yet another industry to prove this, showing that even those operating under the strictest security and compliance requirements see OSS as their preferred approach. For the DoD, that means creating a continuous development pipeline anchored in DevSecOps principles. U.S.com .

Let’s imagine a scenario: you use OpenTelemetry, and your observability backend runs on several hosts. You collect data on application latency, and notice a recent increase that you want to investigate. But how will you know which host caused the degradation? This is exactly where OpenTelmetry resources come in.   In the context of OpenTelemetry, a resource represents the entity producing the telemetry data, such as a container, host, process, service, or operating system.js.id and service.env..

While some monitoring tools excel at a specific task, observability works best when you have a holistic view of your system. You need a platform capable of working with all of your telemetry collectively, otherwise you can end up with a complex, inefficient, and expensive collection of incongruent, siloed tools. That’s what one team at Dell Technologies realized before they made a switch to Grafana Cloud last year. Dell even gained helpful tools in the process, too. “It’s very niche.
