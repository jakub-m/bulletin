by Tomasz Bak and Fabio Kung Introduction Titus is the Netflix cloud container runtime that runs and manages containers at scale. In the time since it was first presented as an advanced Mesos framework, Titus has transparently evolved from being built on top of Mesos to Kubernetes, handling an ever-increasing volume of containers. As the number of Titus users increased over the years, the load and pressure on the system increased substantially.k. Titus Gateway handles user requests. ² Adve, S.

I hope that there’s people in the world who get joy from actually doing the thing and not just solving the problem. And I hope they are at comma. It’s a hobby.

So in these wild times, the “ten year interest rate” is suddenly in the news again. But what does this mean? There is no committee that sets these rates, but it is also not something you can just measure. While you’ll find various other explanations of how to calculate the 10 year interest rate online, this may be the geekiest one, and definitely is the only one with a built-in calculator.

This paper by Bernstein and Goldman appeared in VLDB 1980 . Yes, 1980,  more than 40 years ago. This may be the oldest paper I wrote a summary for. The paper is written by a typewriter! I really didn&#39;t like reading 10&#43; pages in coarse grained typewritten font. I couldn&#39;t even search the pdf for keywords. I really loved the forward looking vision and clear thinking and presentation in the paper. Timestamp order (TSO) based approach is synonymous with optimistic concurrency control (OCC)...e.

I mostly programmed in Go the last few years. So every time I wanted an embedded key-value database, I reached for Cockroach&#39;s Pebble . Pebble is great for Go programming but Go does not embed well into other languages. Pebble was inspired by RocksDB (and its predecessor, LevelDB ). Both were written in C&#43;&#43; which can more easily be embedded into any language with a C foreign function interface. Pebble also has some interesting limitations that RocksDB does not, transactions for example. $ .10.x.

After 9 years, it&#39;s time to retire my old and faithful home Linux machine . It has served me extremely well, by far the longest time I&#39;ve used a home computer without any replacements. The fans were starting to show their age, to the extent that the CPU fan sometimes needs a nudge to start after the machine has been off. While this can be fixed, I also wanted a somewhat faster machine with more memory. It would be nice not to deal with this and have HW that just works .5&#34;x4.

In criminology, there is a theory about broken windows or &#34; clean white walls .&#34; If your building has a broken window and you fix it, then you only had a broken window. But if you do nothing, then vandals will break more windows. Then they might determine that the building is abandoned or unmaintained, leading to graffiti, drug users moving in, and other undesirable activities. The criminal behavior will not be limited to your building. (Hmmm... Those were also easy to identify and block.

“ Negativity bias is a cognitive bias that explains why negative events or feelings typically have a more significant impact on our psychological state than positive events or feelings, even when they are of equal proportion.” Said another way - we’re shaped mostly by the bad stuff that happens to us. In my experience, negativity bias can be one of the fatal flaws of leaders. Read on for how it happens and how to solve it. I want to avoid the specific thing that got all messed up in that period.

Metadata is crucial for serving user requests. It also takes up a lot of space—and as we’ve grown, so has the amount of metadata we’ve had to store. This isn’t a bad problem to have, but we knew it was only a matter of time before our metadata stack would need an overhaul. Dropbox operates two large-scale metadata storage systems powered by sharded MySQL. One is the Filesystem which contains metadata related to files and folders. Both operate at a massive scale.

We were recently the target of a phishing campaign that successfully accessed some of the code we store in GitHub. No one’s content, passwords, or payment information was accessed, and the issue was quickly resolved. Our core apps and infrastructure were also unaffected, as access to this code is even more limited and strictly controlled . We believe the risk to customers is minimal.  We recently learned that Dropbox was targeted by a similar campaign.

Kubernetes today is a game-changing platform that has revolutionized the industry’s approach to building highly-distributed software systems in the cloud. It has been the default form of running your containers for some time now and is the default container orchestrator for most organizations today. At the core of Kubernetes lies its ability to optimize and leverage the containers you create, empowering you to make the most of your servers and utilize your resources strategically.

Who has access to which resources in a system, and what actions they can perform on these resources is of prime importance. Practices like IAM, authorization, and authentication have risen to tackle exactly this problem. However, in practice, modern cloud-native systems that are powered by Kubernetes have made it increasingly difficult for administrators to define and enforce access controls at scale. RBAC and ABAC are two predominant approaches to identity management.

Naming products is hard. One of Tailscale’s key features, MagicDNS, has long been a source of armchair grammar controversy.

MagicDNS is one word because without the magic, it wouldn’t just be DNS; it wouldn’t be anything.conf .com is and gets back 82.58.
