## [Looking for 240/4 Addresses](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-09/2404.html)


In the IANA IPv4 Address registry a block of addresses, 240.0.0.0/4 is marked as reserved for &#34;Future Use&#34;&#34;. If we have run out of available IPv4 addresses, then why are some quarter of a billion IPv4 addresses still sitting idle in an IANA registry waiting for an undefined Future Use?

## [LLMs think](https://acjay.com/2024/09/09/llms-think/)


It&#39;s interesting to see scientific people categorically reject the notion that LLMs &#34;think&#34;. People write them off as &#34;fancy autocomplete&#34; or regurgitating their source material, and conclude that they do something categorically different than what humans can do. I think that&#39;s wrong.

It&#39;s not often that you find yourself staring at code that few people have ever seen, code that was an important part in bringing down the apartheid system in South Africa, and code that was used for secure communication using one-time pads smuggled into South Africa by a flight attendant on floppy disks. But I found myself doing that one morning recently after having helped decrypt a 30 year old PKZIP file whose password had long been forgotten.ZIP and CODMAY93.ZIP .ZIP | head -n 20 bkcrack 1.

## [Reasons I still love the fish shell](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/09/12/reasons-i--still--love-fish/)


I wrote about how much I love fish in this blog post from 2017 and, 7 years of using it every day later, I’ve found even more reasons to love it. So I thought I’d write a new post with both the old reasons I loved it and some reasons. This came up today because I was trying to figure out why my terminal doesn’t break anymore when I cat a binary to my terminal, the answer was “fish fixes the terminal!“, and I just thought that was really nice. 1. It just works the way I want. 2. 3.py fly. 5. 6.

## [Notes on the Euler formula](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2024/notes-on-the-euler-formula/)


The Euler formula states that for any real x : \[e^{ix}=cos(x)&#43;i sin(x)\] Where i is the imaginary unit. This formula is extremely important in many branches of mathematics and engineering, but at first glance it&#39;s puzzling. Now, suppose we have a hypothetical function f(\theta) such that r f(\theta) represents a complex number. Let&#39;s look at it from another direction. Proof using power series The canonical proof of Euler&#39;s formula uses Maclaurin series expansions for e^x , cos(x) and sin(x) .

Introduction: In Episode 1 of the Fearless Concurrency in Rust series, Herbert Wolverson introduces the foundational concept of threads in programming, tracing their origins and evolution while demonstrating how Rust handles concurrency in a safer, more manageable way. He explores the history of threads and their role in enabling programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, comparing Rust’s threading model with traditional approaches in C&#43;&#43; and Go.

This essay is part of a series on offensive horticulture . Some people purchase plants. Other people search for rare plants and sell them. Some plants live in protected places. Taking plants from protected places is called &#34;poaching&#34;. Poaching is illegal. Abducting plants hurts nature. The death of a species reaps unforseeable consequences. We should stop people from poaching plants. We tried telling people to stop poaching, but that didn&#39;t work. Plants can propagate. People must persist.

This post is part of a series on retrowin32 . It&#39;s been just about two years since I left my job . The Saturday after my last day I opened up my laptop and, without before even considering this idea up to that point, spontaneously decided to try writing an Windows emulator to run an old program I loved . I didn&#39;t know much of anything about how emulators work. I could read the occasional x86 assembly when debugging things but I had never written much of it. This turned out to not be true.

By Jason An GDB loses significant functionality when debugging binaries that lack debugging symbols (also known as “stripped binaries”). Function and variable names become meaningless addresses; setting breakpoints requires tracking down relevant function addresses from an external source; and printing out structured values involves staring at a memory dump trying to manually discern field boundaries.

The Go Blog Building LLM-powered applications in Go Eli Bendersky 12 September 2024 As the capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) and adjacent tools like embedding models grew significantly over the past year, more and more developers are considering integrating LLMs into their applications. Since LLMs often require dedicated hardware and significant compute resources, they are most commonly packaged as network services that provide APIs for access. We’re going to build a RAG server in Go.

This allows data to be sent to the device from backend services on demand, without the need for continually polling requests from the device. Over the last few years, Pushy has seen tremendous growth, evolving from its role as a best-effort message delivery service to be an integral part of the Netflix ecosystem..

Chapter 5 of the Designing Data Intensive Applications (DDIA) book discusses strategies and challenges in replicating data across distributed systems. Replication is critical for ensuring data availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. One of the key challenges in replication is maintaining consistency across multiple replicas. Leader-based replication, the most common method, involves a single leader node accepting all writes, while follower nodes replicate the leader&#39;s changes.e.g.g.g.

If you have read any book on time management (and productivity), there is a common theme that all of them begin with— what do you want? While the way to go about this is usually different, almost all begin by getting you to answer some questions: What do you want out of life? What is important to you? What are your goals? This is not a way to pad out the book; there is a fundamental reason for this type of question. These questions give you direction and purpose for your daily work. Homework.

One of my most unexpectedly controversial posts is Extract the Kernel , which argues that executives are generally directionally correct but specifically wrong, and it’s your job to understand the overarching direction without getting distracted by the narrow errors in their idea. Some executives are skeptical of this idea because they don’t like the implication that they’re usually wrong, but they weren’t the audience that was offended. Executive wants to do a giant rewrite of your product.

We had originally planned to go all-in on passkeys for ONCE/Campfire , and we built the early authentication system entirely around that. It was not a simple setup! Handling passkeys properly is surprisingly complicated on the backend, but we got it done. Unfortunately, the user experience kinda sucked, so we ended up ripping it all out again. Much the same way that two-factor authentication can do, but worse, since you&#39;re not even aware of it. Let&#39;s take a simple example.

A big part of the reason that companies are going ga-ga over AI right now is the promise that it might materially lower their payroll for programmers. If a company currently needs 10 programmers to do a job, each have a cost of $200,000/year, then that&#39;s a $2m/year problem. If AI could even cut off 1/4 of that, they would have saved half a million! Cut double that, and it&#39;s a million. Programmers continuing to become more expensive, computers continuing to become less so.

Technical debt is a popular metaphor for communicating the long-term implications of architectural decisions and trade-offs to stakeholders. By exploiting the feedback mechanism of the Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA) approach, we have concluded that the technical debt metaphor is misleading because much of the so-called debt never needs to be, and in fact isn’t, repaid.

## [MongoDB Performance Regression Benchmarking and the Truth Behind Journaling](https://www.percona.com/blog/mongodb-performance-regression-benchmarking-and-the-truth-behind-journaling/)


I have always been wondering about performance regression when upgrading in MongoDB. From MongoDB v3.6, despite continuous improvement in the MongoDB feature development, the growing feature set has not included much, if anything in the way of performance improvements. At Percona, we always strive to boost the overall performance by looking into the customers’ environment […]

Database novices often wonder how ‘things work behind the scenes’ when starting with PostgreSQL. Many things happen when creating a table and adding data that are not apparent. You might ask, ‘Where does the data go?’ Luckily, it is easy to discover the details. Creating a table Creating a table creates a lot of metadata […]

## [Tiny Great Languages: APL](https://zserge.com/posts/langs-apl/)


This is part 5 from series “Tiny Great Languages”. Final code is on Github. Part 1: Assembly. Part 2: BASIC. Part 3: Forth/MOUSE. Part 4: Lisp. Part 5: APL/K. This would be a controversial language, but it fits perfectly into the 50-lines-of-less code category. Let’s talk about APL family, and specifically – K. Created by Arthur Whitney the language is known for its terse and cryptic syntax. But it fixes one “issue” with APL – K uses ASCII symbols.

Lisp is famous for its minimalist syntax (similar to Forth, the parser is almost nonexistent) and its clear, logical evaluation rules.

One of the biggest advantages of the OpenTelemetry project is its vendor neutrality — something that many community members appreciate, especially if they’ve spent huge amounts of time migrating from one commercial vendor to another. Vendor neutrality also happens to be a core element of our big tent philosophy here at Grafana Labs. We realize, however, that this neutrality can have its limits when it comes to real-world use cases.png&#34; alt=&#34;A diagram depicting the layers of telemetry.

A year ago we rebuilt our alert rule state history , using Grafana Loki for storage and updating the UI to display a timeline of all state changes of an alert rule. As a result, users can now conduct better root cause analysis by going down to the level of an alert rule and seeing when certain alert instances started or stopped firing. But we aren’t stopping there. To ensure system stability and avert outages, you also need one place to see the state history for all the alerts in your system.

## [The Next Frontier for EV Batteries: Nanoscale Coatings](https://spectrum.ieee.org/atomic-layer-deposition)


Over the past 25 years, the longest driving range of an electric vehicle on a single charge has gone from about 260 kilometers to slightly over 800 km. Increasingly, these advanced battery packs have also begun storing energy from the grid or renewable sources to power homes or businesses. No wonder, then, that the global automotive battery market has surpassed US $50 billion a year and there is increasing pressure to produce greater numbers of even better batteries. .

## [Transistor-like Qubits Hit Key Benchmark](https://spectrum.ieee.org/qubit-transistor)


A team in Australia has recently demonstrated a key advance in metal-oxide-semiconductor-based (or MOS-based) quantum computers. They showed that their two-qubit gates—logical operations that involve more than one quantum bit, or qubit—perform without errors 99 percent of the time. This number is important, because it is the baseline necessary to perform error correction , which is believed to be necessary to build a large-scale quantum computer. Quantinuum and IonQ use individual trapped ions .

This article is based on the authors’ new book, Fantasies of Virtual Reality (The MIT Press). In 2017 Mark Zuckerberg stated a bold goal: He wanted one billion people to try virtual reality (VR) by 2027. While he still has a few years to pull it off, the target remains impossibly farfetched. The most recent estimates place total worldwide VR headset sales at only 34 million . Aspirational attempts to reach this flawed fantasy have squashed the true potential of VR for gaming. Allen J.

Drowning is the third leading cause of accidental deaths globally, according to the World Health Organization . The deaths disproportionately impact low- and middle-income communities, whose beaches tend to lack lifeguards because of limited funds. Last year 104 drownings of the 120 reported in the United States occurred on unstaffed beaches. That fueled Angelina Kim’s drone project. Kim is a senior at the Bishop’s School in La Jolla, Calif. It also was given out at ISEF.C.C.

When an international team of researchers set out to create an “AI scientist” to handle the whole scientific process, they didn’t know how far they’d get. Would the system they created really be capable of generating interesting hypotheses, running experiments, evaluating the results, and writing up papers? What they ended up with, says researcher Cong Lu , was an AI tool that they judged equivalent to an early Ph.D. student.D. student taking a wild guess at why something worked,” Lu says.D.J.D.

In the 1800s, aluminum was considered more valuable than gold or silver because it was so expensive to produce the metal in any quantity. Thanks to the Hall-Héroult smelting process , which pioneered the electrochemical reduction of aluminum oxide in 1886, electrochemistry advancements made aluminum more available and affordable, rapidly transforming it into a core material used in the manufacturing of aircraft, power lines, food-storage containers and more.
