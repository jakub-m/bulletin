## [Online Dating](https://geohot.github.io//blog/jekyll/update/2024/08/02/online-dating.html)


Is anyone having a good experience with this? What would it take to fix this? I investigate. First off, you need a business model that isn’t mobile gaming. A monthly fee. Even better, you have a great thing to “ sin tax .” Single men. Charge men money per month. Only men. Every club promoter understands this. You don’t want your club to be a sausage fest, similarly, you don’t want your dating app to be a sausage fest. Seeking is one of the only sites to do this right.

## [Standardizing](https://staysaasy.com/management/2024/08/06/standardize.html)


A classic problem for any sizable organization is to decide where to standardize and where to allow autonomy. At its core, all organizations must have some things they require of all members. Otherwise, is it really an organization? While some standardization is necessary, many managers and leaders standardize just for the heck of it. Standardizing things feels productive, like cleaning up a messy room, and is a go-to move for leaders when they don’t know exactly what to do next.” And it’s not.

The Space Shuttle contained a bulky printer so the astronauts could receive procedures, mission plans, weather reports, crew activity plans, and other documents. Needed for the first Shuttle launch in 1981, this printer was designed in just 7 months, built around an Army communications terminal. Unlike modern printers, the Shuttle&#39;s printer contains a spinning metal drum with raised characters, allowing it to rapidly print a line at a time. The Space Shuttle&#39;s Interim Teleprinter...

As a site reliability engineer, you need constant vigilance and a keen eye for detail if you want to manage your Kubernetes infrastructure effectively. As part of that effort, you need to see the historical data from your pods, nodes, and clusters — even after they’ve been deleted or recreated. Complexity: You have to orchestrate multiple commands and tools to get a complete historical view. Not only is this time-consuming and expensive, it can also open the door to mistakes and missing data.

These interactions generate a massive volume of event logs, containing valuable information like user details, geographical locations, IP addresses, and more. These logs are essential for security teams, especially in operations, because they’re used to detect and respond to incidents effectively.97.

As we continue adding to our growing catalog of more than 100 plugins for Grafana, we have been focused on developing data sources for Grafana that are more purpose-built for the respective technologies. One example has been the recent update to our core Prometheus data source. We have deprecated AWS authentication from the original Prometheus data source, and we created a new dedicated Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus plugin that will specifically cater to the AWS use case.com .

It doesn’t matter how many things are on your to-do list if you don’t have the time to do them. It took me many years to understand that traditional task-based productivity systems don’t work. They focus on doing more and more, never allowing you time to stop to ask if what’s on your to-do list needs to be done. This began to change when I discovered time-based productivity. Over the last few years, I have fine-tuned this approach and taught it to my students and coaching clients.

Artificial neural networks —algorithms inspired by biological brains—are at the center of modern artificial intelligence, behind both chatbots and image generators. But with their many neurons, they can be black boxes , their inner workings uninterpretable to users. Researchers have now created a fundamentally new way to make neural networks that in some ways surpasses traditional systems. “It’s great to see that there is a new architecture on the table.” You might get a tidy function.
