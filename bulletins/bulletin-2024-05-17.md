Stone has of course been used for thousands of years as a construction material, and is still used today for things like building cladding. For instance, the

Growing a helicopter seems impossible: It demands an ambient-yet-unwavering attention-to-detail. It demands a respect for science with a flare for style. It demands becoming 100% CEO, 100% factory floor, and 100% regulatory body. It demands your eyes, your ears, your mind, your sleep, and your stomach. -- Taylor

Last December, my wife decided that her goal for 2024 was to embark on a postgraduate degree in physical therapy. She looked at the curriculum and announced it would only be twelve hours of lectures each week, and she could easily find that time. Two months into the course, she’s had to cut back on her social time. She’s struggling to squeeze in her weekly dance classes, and poor Louis (our little Yorkshire Terrier) rarely gets to walk with her. Most meeting times are randomly selected.

In this post we&#39;ll build a database in 400 lines of code with basic support for five standard SQL transaction levels: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Snapshot Isolation and Serializable. We&#39;ll use multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) and optimistic concurrency control (OCC) to accomplish this. The goal isn&#39;t to be perfect but to explain the basics in a minimal way. You don&#39;t need to know what these terms mean in advance. I did not understand them before doing this project.

Building reliable stateful services at scale isn’t a matter of building reliability into the servers, the clients, or the APIs in isolation. By combining smart and meaningful choices for each of these three components, we can build massively scalable, SLO-compliant stateful services at Netflix. By Joseph Lynch

Back when I started programming professionally, every expert and every software engineering professor would swear by object-oriented programming. Resistance was futile. History had spoken: the future was object-oriented. It is hard to understate how strong the mania was. In education, we started calling textbooks and videos ‘learning objects‘. Educators would soon ‘combine learning objects and reuse them‘. A competitor … Continue reading Learning from the object-oriented mania

Durable PHP is an evolving framework intended for writing scalable, complex code, currently focusing on advanced authorization concepts like fine-grain resource interactions including orchestration and entity management. It provides strict user-resource interaction rules enforced by the system&#39;s infrastructure, enhancing security by limiting access based on ownership and permissions.

Durable PHP is an evolving framework designed for creating complex, scalable code, currently exploring distributed locking mechanisms. It facilitates locking multiple entities in a single operation, which poses significant deadlock risks. By adhering to rules like deterministic lock ordering and mandating lock release on orchestration termination, most deadlocks are preventable.

Using open source software does not entitle you to a vote on the direction of the project. The gift you&#39;ve received is the software itself and the freedom of use granted by the license. That&#39;s it, and this ought to be straight forward, but I repeatedly see that it is not (no matter how often it is repeated ). And I think the problem stems from the word &#34;community&#34;, which implies a democratic decision-making process that never actually existed in the open source world. I don&#39;t think it would.

It may be more expensive, but big companies project an image of stability and reliability, so buying their wares is seen as the prudent choice. Except, it isn&#39;t. Certainly not any more. Meta killing Workplace is merely exhibit #49667. This, right here, is the risk of buying anything from big tech like Meta and Google.

Witness this tabulation of DEI (and ESG) mentions in earnings reports, reported by Business Insider : It&#39;s over.

The Canvas panel, which was generally available in Grafana 10, combines the power of Grafana with the flexibility of custom elements. Canvas visualizations are extensible, form-built panels you can use to explicitly place elements within static and dynamic layouts. This allows you to design custom visualizations and overlay data in ways that aren’t possible with standard Grafana panels. Best part? It can all be done within Grafana’s UI. TLDR: Your vertices will not move when elements do.grafana.

The maturity of your alerting strategy has a direct impact on the reliability of your infrastructure and your applications. It can also have a big impact on engineering productivity. So whether you’re talking about resolving incidents faster or avoiding alerting fatigue, alerting should always be front and center. In recent months we’ve worked hard to make it easier to create, manage, and triage alerts.m.) in order to modify where that alert is delivered. View alerts via dashboards.

One of the superpowers of Grafana is the ability to bring all of your data into a single platform thanks to our rich catalog of data sources. Oftentimes you will want to visualize information from disparate data sources together in a single dashboard or panel. Or you might want to refine data returned from queries without altering the original data source. Or you may need to modify data due to limitations of a query language that stops you from getting the required formatting. Debugging. 1. 2.

At GrafanaCON 2024, Grafana founder Torkel Ödegaard introduced Grafana 11 , which has a feature set that aligns with the same goals we’ve had since the OSS project launched in 2013 .  “The core mission of Grafana that we’ve had from the start is to make observability easy and powerful through good UX design, a focus on ease of use, and user flexibility and freedom,” Torkel said. Get started with Explore Metrics in Grafana 11 Explore Metrics is available in public preview in Grafana 11.

One of the most powerful features of Grafana is the ability to unify and derive value from your data, regardless of where that data lives. This is because we’re fully committed to making Grafana an open, composable, and extensible observability platform for our more than 20 million users worldwide. But how exactly do we deliver on that promise of openness and extensibility? Grafana data source plugins play a big role. Most of these data sources are freely available for use in Grafana OSS.

Scientists have predicted that by 2040, almost 50 percent of the world’s electric power will be used in computing. What’s more, this projection was made before the sudden explosion of generative AI. The amount of computing resources used to train the largest AI models has been doubling roughly every 6 months for more than the past decade. Simply put, computing will require colossal amounts of power, soon exceeding what our planet can provide. Superconductors could let us do just that.

It’s hard to think of a more dramatic way to make an entrance than falling from the sky. While it certainly happens often enough on the silver screen, whether or not it can be done in real life is a tantalizing challenge for our entertainment robotics team at Disney Research. Falling is tricky for two reasons. The first and most obvious is what Douglas Adams referred to as “the sudden stop at the end.” Every second of free fall means another 9. In our case, being able to hover isn’t a necessity.

I’ve personally experienced how amazing it is to use Shadow Hands in a teleoperation context, and it’s hard to imagine anything better. The problem with the original Shadow hand was (and still is) fragility. Or a two-fingered hand.
