When people describe progress, they often describe it in terms of a linear progression taking us from primitive to advanced ‚Äî an idea or invention occurs as a singular event, and somewhere further down the line of time a new idea or invention completely replaces it, relegating the old to the annals of history. This viewpoint is exemplified by traditional worldviews that organize all beings according to a chain of evolution, sometimes called the ‚Äúgreat chain of being‚Äù (or scala naturae).

Developers Want Control and Visibility The importance of DevOps is now widely recognized across the industry. The value is no longer anecdotal, it&#39;s been quantifiably demonstrated through ample research. If you want a deep dive - here it is. A key contributor to these radical improvements lies in development teams owning their services from code to production.

The code (C&#43;&#43;) is also available as opensource. Consus introduces a leaderless-consensus-based commit protocol that completes in three one way message delays in the wide area. In this setup, each data center has a full replica of the data and a transaction processing engine. The commit protocol has 3 phases.

## [ Why should this paper be published?](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/05/why-should-this-paper-be-published.html)


Here is a simple suggestion that will immensely improve the publishing/reviewing experience. Every submission should include a subsection called: &#34;Why should this paper be published?&#34; (WSTPBP). Here, the authors should provide an objective/falsifiable statement of why this paper deserves publication. If one of these statements is falsified by the reviewers, it could be a valid reason to reject the paper. In that sense, WSTPBP is the authors&#39; contract with the reviewers.
