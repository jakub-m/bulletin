This article was discussed on Hacker News . Over the past year I’ve refined my approach to arena allocation . With practice, it’s effective, simple, and fast; typically as easy to use as garbage collection but without the costs. Depending on need, an allocator can weigh just 7–25 lines of code — perfect when lacking a runtime . With the core details of my own technique settled, now is a good time to document and share lessons learned. We’ll get to that. Objects are not freed individually. tail .

Walter Isaacson&#39;s new book about Elon Musk is a fine biography, but an even better business book. And like all the best business books, it&#39;s not merely an instruction manual, but an inspirational guide too. Not since reading Ricardo Semler&#39;s Maverick in the early 2000s have I been this impressed with the foresight, fortitude, and ferocity of a founder. Musk is truly one of a kind. I know positive statements like that about Musk can trigger some people. Then make the requirements less dumb.

As companies start to roll out so-called “Return to Office” (RTO) policies, I’ve found myself disappointed by the hyperbolic arguments being made by remote work / Work From Home (WFH) proponents. I believe that neither remote work nor colocated work is globally “better”: which one works best is contextual, depending on the role and the needs of the team.

“Don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions” is a common message that one imagines a stereotypical CEO saying to their teams. While this literal phrase isn’t particularly common in the wild, it’s rooted in some deep underlying truths about communication with executives. In this post, we’ll dissect this catchphrase as a means of analyzing how to effectively communicate upwards, whether to a senior manager, head of function, or CEO. There are obvious benefits to communicating well.

Check out the project on Github. I recently published a new project for repeatable filesystem benchmarking. This code is based on the benchmarks available in the AWS Mountpoint-s3 project and the Flexible I/O Tester, made into a more general purpose utility for benchmarking arbitrary filesystems. The benchmark consists of a mix of read and write workloads, each run for ten iterations. The average result of the ten iterations is reported as the final result of the benchmark.

Introduction Postgres queue tech is a thing of beauty, but far from mainstream. Its relative obscurity is partially attributable to the cargo cult of “scale”. The scalability cult has decreed that there are several queue technologies with greater “scalability” than Postgres, and for that reason alone, Postgres isn’t suitably scalable for anyone’s queueing needs. Postgres’ operational simplicity be dammed; scale first, operate later. Yet some intrepid technologists, such as those at webapp.g.e.

These are speaking notes for my October 4th, QCon talk in San Francisco. Slides for this talk. Over the course of my career, I’ve frequently heard from colleagues, team members and random internet strangers with the same frustration: the company doesn’t have an Engineering strategy. I don’t think this problem is unique to Engineering: it’s also common to hear folks complain that they’re missing a strategy for Product, Design or Business.g.” Disappointingly, this is the same list in both cases.g.

After some research, I can unconfidently say: it&#39;s complicated. The &#34;first version&#34; of JavaScript did in fact take ten days. The exact dates aren&#39;t confirmed, but Brendan Eich recalls it being May 6-15, 1995 . But this was only a minimal prototype (&#34;Mocha&#34;) for internal demonstration.

Within a few short years, it seemed like everybody in the world was carrying a blowgun. Two decades ago, a blowgun was an unwieldy rod you hung on your wall for recreation and emergencies. Modern blowguns are Swiss-army-flavored. A baseline model retails for $299 and acts as a telescope, microscope, megaphone, pencil, camera, snorkel, food thermometer, pregnancy test, and flute. For this reason, many call it &#34;the magic wand&#34;. Blowguns shrunk. Social pressure is palpable. Willpower is waste.

However, capturing a dynamic scene using a single camera is fundamentally limited.
