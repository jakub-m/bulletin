Victor Frankl wrote Man’s Search for Meaning after surviving a concentration camp during World War II. He observed the outer  extreme of what happens to people who no longer have a WHY to live for. They’d wither and die in the camp. Even the most dire rations and punishing labor could be survived by many, as long as they had a purpose still beckoning, but once that light went out, so did they. A truth he spent the rest of his life trying to teach in the form of logotherapy as a psychotherapist.

One of the driving aspirations behind once.com is the notion that not all software needs to evolve forever. We’ve become so used to digital services being malleable that we’ve confused the possibility of software updates with their necessity. Some software can simply be finished, and a lot would be better if it were. That’s basically the antithesis of SaaS. Which relies on the pitch that the system is always improving to get people to pay every month. More capable, more secure, more, more, more.

It’s that time of year where people often start thinking about new year’s resolutions. I want to lose 10 lbs, I want to read more books, I want to x, y, and z. Often, it’s just a fantasy. They’re not actually going to lose 10 lbs or they might order some more books but never read them. But at least there’s a spark of hope there. A fundamental faith that they could become a better them. I think that’s tremendously admirable. That’s not impossible, of course, but it’s hard. Forty hours a week.

People have expected apps to rotate with their mobile devices since before the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. It’s especially important for productivity apps to adapt and let people choose how they want to utilize their screen space. With the newest version of the Replit Mobile App, you can now code in both landscape and portrait modes. This creates a significantly improved experience on smaller tablets like the iPad mini or larger phones like the Pixel Fold.
