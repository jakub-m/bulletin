I&#39;ve been running FotoForensics for over a decade, and I really thought I had seen it all. Before I wrote the first line of code for FotoForensics, I had consulted with friends, law enforcement, and attorneys about my various liabilities. This is why I don&#39;t allow things like pornography, identity cards, and other sensitive documents on the public web site. For example: Pornography is legal (1st Amendment, free speech). However, child pornography is illegal (18 U.S.C. 2251 , 2252 , 2258 , etc.).

## [ The end of a myth: Distributed transactions can scale](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-end-of-myth-distributed.html)


This paper appeared in VLDB&#39;17. The paper presents NAM-DB, a scalable distributed database system that uses RDMA (mostly 1-way RDMA) and a novel timestamp oracle to support snapshot isolation (SI) transactions. NAM stands for network-attached-memory architecture, which leverages RDMA to enable compute nodes talk directly to a pool of memory nodes. Remote direct memory access (RDMA) allows bypassing the CPU when transferring data from one machine to another. The two papers share one author.g.g.e.

I spent the last 2 weeks travelling around India, and I came up with this line: There’s a fine line that defines civilization. Several beggars approached me on the street, and I didn’t give them anything. I suspect they would be surprised to learn that we have worse beggars in America. At least the people here didn’t look like they were crazy or on drugs. Homelessness is a growing problem in America, and I think I have a solution everyone can be happy with. I propose Wireheading City .

Having to communicate in a language other than our native tongue can be quite a challenge, especially without a script or prepared speech. In this &#34;Best of&#34; episode, we revisit Matt&#39;s conversation with Kenneth Romeo about specific tactics that non-native speakers can use to handle in-the-moment challenges. Romeo also discusses why letting go of perfection is a key step toward speaking with confidence. Romeo is a professor at Waseda University in Japan. See Privacy Policy at https://art19.

Hi, it’s us again. You might remember us from when we made significant performance-related changes to wireguard-go , the userspace WireGuard ® implementation that Tailscale uses. We’re releasing a set of changes that further improves client throughput on Linux. We intend to upstream these changes to WireGuard as we did with the previous set of changes, which have since landed upstream . How did we do it? Through UDP segmentation offload and checksum optimizations. The changes we made in v1.31.0.

When I went on Windows full time in 2019 I decided to avoid WSL as much as I could, which meant learning the Windows-native ways of doing things, which meant learning PowerShell . It was a pretty rough start! There are some affordances for people used to bash, but anything more complicated than “copy a file” doesn’t translate at all. Once I got more used to it, though, I found that I really like powershell. And okay, maybe make a few bash users go “damn I want that trick”. No parsing needed....

#517 – April 10, 2023 Remaining Relevant Over Four Decades Four decades is a long time to be a programmer. I started in 1981 and retired in 2021. During that time, almost everything changed, and I had to change with it. While my situation may be different than starting today, much of what I learned over time can still be helpful to programmers today.

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration. More and more companies are seeing the benefits of moving to cloud-native - speed, agility, scalability, and improved productivity - and are adopting Kubernetes. Despite its growing popularity and all the advantages it brings, Kubernetes is quite complex. A recent study found that 4 in 5 people (running Kubernetes in production) admit that Kubernetes is more complex than other technologies they use.
