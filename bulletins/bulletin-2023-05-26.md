## [The absurd cost of finalizers in Go](https://lemire.me/blog/2023/05/19/the-absurd-cost-of-finalizers-in-go/)


The Go programming language makes it easy to call C code. Suppose you have the following C functions: char* allocate() { return (char*)malloc(100); } void free_allocated(char *c) { free(c); } Then you can call them from Go as follows: c := C.allocate() C.free_allocated(c) It works well. You might argue that my functions are useless, but … Continue reading The absurd cost of finalizers in Go

## [Generating Large Test Files](https://sookocheff.com/post/linux/generating-large-files/)


I was recently testing file upload performance, and needed several large files of different sizes to test with. To make the math easier, it was helpful if I had files with round numbered sizes like 10MB, 20MB, or 100MB. After searching around for files of the right size, it turns out the easiest solution is to generate one yourself using the Linux command line. Depending on your needs, you can use two different methods of generating files using some simple commands.

## [Um, like, so: How filler words can create more connected, effective communication](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu)


We’re often advised not to use “um” or “uh”, or “so” and “you know” in our communication. But linguist Valerie Fridland might argue otherwise. “Language is about how we encode both the linguistic message and a social message,” she says. “Crutch words … are really valuable and they have arisen to serve a need. For example, Fridland says, the way we use “um” varies greatly from how and we might use “uh.  Fridland is a professor of sociolinguistics at the University of Nevada.

## [New playground: memory spy](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/05/25/new-playground--memory-spy/)


Hello! Today we’re releasing a new playground called “memory spy”. It lets you run C programs and see how their variables are represented in memory. It’s designed to be accessible to folks who don’t know C – it comes with bunch of extremely simple example C programs that you can poke at. Here’s the link: &gt;&gt; Memory Spy &lt;&lt; This is a companion to the “how integers and floats work” zine we’ve been working on, so the goal is mostly to look at how number types (integers and floats) are represented.

Satellite radios today serve hundreds of channels across 9,540,000 square miles. Unless you’re working at a secret military facility, deep underground, you can enjoy satellite radio everywhere. Punch cards, plotters, light pens and lots more.

## [Implementing a distributed key-value store on top of implementing Raft in Go](http://notes.eatonphil.com/2023-05-25-raft.html)


As part of bringing myself up-to-speed after joining TigerBeetle , I wanted some background on how distributed consensus and replicated state machines protocols work. TigerBeetle uses Viewstamped Replication . But I wanted to understand all popular protocols and I decided to start with Raft . We&#39;ll implement two key components of Raft in this post (leader election and log replication). Around 1k lines of Go. Disclaimer : I&#39;m not an expert. My implementation isn&#39;t yet hooked up to Jepsen .go .db.

## [May 18 Replit downtime](https://blog.replit.com/may-18-replit-downtime)


Yesterday, we had a period of about 2h from 11:45 to 13:56 (Pacific Time) in which all users were unable to access their Repls through the site. We have addressed the root cause, and the system is now operating normally. We know a two-hour downtime is not acceptable for you or your users. This post summarizes what happened and what we&#39;re doing to improve Replit so that this does not happen again. During this migration, a latent bug that we had not hit was introduced.

If you want to run a company that&#39;s light on full-time managers, you have to focus on managing processes before people. The traditional paradigm of a reporting manager that&#39;s constantly following up with their reports, conducting daily stand-up meetings, weekly 1-1s, and all other forms of intensive supervision, needs to be (mostly) replaced with an asynchronous, self-managing paradigm instead. Let&#39;s look at five ways that principle works in practice at 37signals .

## [AWS ECS Tutorial: Running Your Containers on Amazon](https://earthly.dev/blog/aws-ecs-tutorial/)


Containerization is the process of bundling the components of an application ( ie files, libraries, and application code) into a single package that can be run consistently on any infrastructure. Containerization continues to grow in popularity because it’s portable, has built-in fault tolerance, and is easily scalable. Docker is a popular containerization solution because it allows you to build, test, deploy, and run applications within containers quickly. Let’s start by creating a new service.
