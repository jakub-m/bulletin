                                A few years ago, I was working on a new version of Allegro purchase ratings. It was a time of a pretty large revolution in the rating system when we moved this product away from our monolith, also introducing quite significant changes to the concept of purchase rating itself. The product-related revolution was accompanied by a major change in technology. Apart from transitioning towards the microservices architecture, we also decided to migrate data from a large relational database to MongoDB.0.

                                First some good personal news: I did a hiatus over the summer due to severe depression issues. Well, I finally got into an intensive outpatient program, which so far seems to be helping, and I’m optimistic it’ll leave me in a better place longterm. Now some bad professional news: IOPs are both really time-consuming and mentally exhausting, which makes it hard to do more than my core client work. That’s why the last newsletter was pretty off-the-cuff opinions— it’s a lot less mental overhead...

At least this is what I’ve been told, my coworkers are big fans and report having a small memory footprint, a shallow learning curve, and an excellent standard library. So in this article, I’m going to give it a try with a simple project I’ve been wanting to build: an activity tracker.

                                For a long time, the path to engineering manager began with a prolonged stint of technical leadership. Then you’d transition into an initial management role that balanced people and technical responsibilities. Some companies call this a tech lead manager role. Folks entering those sorts of managerial roles were often the senior-most technical contributor on their team. Today it’s common for first-time managers to get the advice that they should immediately stop writing code at work.

                                I love learning. I wanted to write about how I learn, so I can analyze if there is a method to this madness. I will first talk about what my learning process looks like in abstract terms, and then I&#39;ll give an analogy to make things more concrete and visual.   Learning is a messy process for me I know some very clear thinkers. They are very organized and methodical. I am not like that. They speak in precise statements and have clear and hard-set opinions about the subject. I am a messy learner.

                                As we approach the end of 2021, it&#39;s informative to look back at how much change has gone on in the industry. One of the biggest transitions we&#39;ve seen in enterprise networking has taken place in the data center. Software-defined approaches that emerged over the past decade have matured and are being deployed in production.

                                Back in 2020, I had wrote nine blog entries that covered a wide range of vulnerabilities. Many of them were well-known to the Tor Project (some nearly a decade old!) but had never been addressed and had no viable mitigation options or alternatives. Other issues were brand new and first disclosed on my blog. (The last blog entry begins with a summary of the vulnerabilities.) Of all of the vulnerabilities and concerns that I raised in 2020, the Tor Project didn&#39;t address any of them. Zero.0.0.com.

                                Two major events in the GitOps calendar just took place within a month of each other - KubeCon NA 2021 and the GitOps One Stop Shop. Here are our highlights. KubeCon North America 2021 was notable from the outset for the fact that it was a real, in-person event. After close to two years of attending events virtually, it was great to get together in person once again. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t some great GitOps-related sessions presented as part of the main KubeCon event.

                                TrueTime is Google’s solution to providing to globally consistent timestamps to determine ordering of events. Originally developed to support the Spanner distributed database, TrueTime is a clock implementation that depends on two key factors: well engineered and accurate GPS and atomic clocks and the representation of time as an interval of uncertainty. Representing TrueTime TrueTime explicitly represents each timestamp an interval that includes bounded time uncertainty.

                                Vector clocks are an extension of Lamport Clocks designed to determine all correct orderings of events in a distributed system. Whereas Lamport Clocks yield one of the many possible event orderings, this does not for certain classes of problems that require knowledge of global program state such as reversing the order of execution to recover from errors or rollback. In such cases, it is more useful to have access to the entire set of orderings that are causally consistent at any moment in time.

                                Logging stuff is in the news this week. Specifically, people with Java and log4j somewhere in their lives are having a miserable time. I figured I&#39;d re-tell a story about terrible things done by way of a bunch of feature-rich libraries and dubious interconnections. I&#39;ve mentioned this in passing before, but this time I&#39;ve tried to be much more specific about how it works. Part 1: the flags. There is a C&#43;&#43; library called GFLAGS. This then becomes a global (!) flag/argument........... ..... And...

                                Hello, world! A couple of days ago, I noticed someone remarking on a line from an older post of mine that had been making the rounds. In it, I say something about adding a number to &#34;my list of magic numbers&#34;. That person wanted to see that list. It turns out that I&#39;ve never written this down in any one coherent list... until now.

Now nearly a decade in, this globetrotter is collaborating with his AI team from his new home in Madrid.

                                We’re joined by Eran Yahav — talking about AI assistants for developers. Eran has been working on this problem for more than a decade. We talk about his path to now and how the idea for Tabnine came to life, this AI revolution taking place and the role it will play in developer productivity, and we talk about the elephant in the room - how Tabnine compares to GitHub Copilot, and what they’re doing to make Tabnine the AI assistant for every developer regardless of the IDE or editor you choose.

                                In 2014 Gerhard joined CloudCredo, a startup co-founded by Colin Humphreys, Paula Kennedy &amp; Chris Hedley. They stuck together through two acquisitions: Pivotal &amp; VMware. This year, Colin, Paula &amp; Chris co-founded Syntasso, the Platform-as-a-Product startup. Your hunch is right, all of them used to share the same Pivotal London office with Tammer Saleh, our guest from episode 31. Chris used to win all table tennis matches without even breaking a sweat, and today Gerhard gets his comeback. Touché!

                                GitOps has become a buzzword. Developers love it, because it folds DevOps into Git, a frequently used and familiar tool. Using one tool to manage multiple DevOps activities sounds fantastic, and it can be helpful for many. The truth is GitOps has limits. In this article, we explore DevOps and GitOps, compare their similarities and differences, and examine how their principles can work together to support your software development goals. Everyone works together to achieve a DevOps culture.

In our technology-driven business climate, most companies have at least some, if not all, workloads on the cloud. And unlike on-premises networks, these cloud environments lack secure outer perimeters and specific off times. Cloud networks are always on and always available. While convenient, this also means hackers can access them at any time. This disruption can include ransomware attacks.

                                During my time as a penetration tester, I’ve seen many IT teams storing server catalogs with respective IP addresses and passwords in a sharable Excel sheet. This is more so true in windows server infrastructure as many organizations resort to password-based auth for local and remote access. Of course, security-conscious organizations would use a password vault. But in any case, password storage in any form is often an Achilles heel in infrastructure security.

                                Yesterday I wrote about the fact that quaternions, unlike complex numbers, can form conjugates via a series of multiplications and additions. This post will show that you can do something similar with octonions. If x is an octonion x = r0 e0 &#43; r1 e1 &#43; … &#43; r7 e7 where all the r‘s are […] The post Conjugate theorem for octonions first appeared on John D. Cook .

                                I learn best when I have to describe something from the ground up! In “reinventing” articles, I’ll try to describe the mathematical intuitions necessary to implement a technology for yourself! I didn’t love any of the LSTM graphics I found, so I made my own!

The sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent function are visually similar.

This is the first article in a series of increasingly technical explanations. I hope the intuitions help you, too! Sound is a mechanical wave, a vibration in the air or another medium. Musical notes correspond to the frequency of the wave. These waves propagate through space over time. As a wave reaches a microphone, it wiggles a structure called the diaphragm.

Unfortunately, the lab and the real world are two different playfields : Algorithms work great if the data they see is similar to the ones they were trained on, but this is not always the case.g.; Geography — e.g.g. 1.e.1.

Text classification is the task of assigning a sentence or document an appropriate category. The categories depend on the selected dataset and can cover arbitrary subjects. Therefore, text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize any kind of text. Common approaches use supervised learning to classify texts. Image by author. 2.

                                As I look back on 2021 I&#39;m proud to see a fast growing number of companies use our data platform to unlock new insights, build new business models and help improve their employees’ and their customers&#39; experience. Data itself is just inactive information, useless without activation. The true power of data comes when it’s being used to build intelligent applications, help people make better decisions, increase automation and ultimately change how value is being created.
