As Cohen explores in his new book, Belonging: The Science of Creating Connection and Bridging Divides , achieving a sense of belonging isn’t just a nice-to-have — it’s essential.

Introduction In the first post of this series, I discussed the binary search API from the slices package that is now part of the standard library with the release of versionb 1.21. In this post, I will share how the Clip, Clone, and Compact APIs work. Clip The Clip API can be used to remove unused capacity from a slice. This means reducing the capacity of the slice to match its length.

One of the lesser-known features of the 8086 is the &#34;hold&#34; functionality, which allows an external device to temporarily take control of the system&#39;s bus. This blog post explains in detail how the bus hold feature is implemented in the processor&#39;s logic.e.e.e.  ↩

The good news is: I&#39;m over the laryngitis. (Over a month without a voice!) The bad news? My voice is still hoarse enough to prevent me from recording the final part of my video series. So I had an idea. Since my computers use AI to manage themselves, they might as well give the presentation using AI! Each computer is named after a type of jelly. Using a cool text-to-speech system, I gave Chutney a voice. If you block them fast enough (e.g. Part 3 ( blog and video ) covered more active solutions.

As I mentioned in the last post , I’m working on taking my little videogame scripting language and turning it into a statically typed one. As much as possible, I’m trying to make the language simple and familiar. But sometimes those goals are in opposition and the most familiar solution to a problem is kind of a mess. So, I’m also exploring novel approaches and delving deeper into programming language history to scavenge forgotten ideas. By that, I mean: Data that might or might not be present..

The most recent iteration in this journey is that of GitOps and Flux CD and its approach to deployment automation. Further, in 2023, Flux CD v2’s GA (General Availability) was announced.

## [Symmetric Properties](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/symmetric-properties/)


If you take a square and rotate it 90 degrees, you get back an identical square. We say the square is rotationally symmetric . Similarly, if you reflect it across an axis, you also get the same square. Since &#34;reflectionally&#34; isn&#39;t a word, we can more generally say it&#39;s &#34;symmetric under reflection&#34;. If you take any two numbers and compute x &#43; y , you&#39;ll get the same answer if you instead compute y &#43; x . In formal specification, we can express symmetries as properties of the system.

Highlights NOCD struggled with long build times and latency in their CI builds due to a lack of caching and, after caching was implemented with Earthly, slow cache downloads and uploads. They implemented Earthly and Earthly Satellites. Earthly’s automatic caching sped up builds, and Earthly Satellites’ instantly available cache eliminated latency in their CI caused by cache downloads and uploads. It was the same kind of case as switching to Earthly for us. It’s been astounding. It’s pretty big.

## [What helps people get comfortable on the command line?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/08/08/what-helps-people-get-comfortable-on-the-command-line-/)


Sometimes I talk to friends who need to use the command line, but are intimidated by it. There obviously isn’t one single thing that works for everyone – different people take different paths. I think there are three parts to getting comfortable: reducing risks , motivation and resources . I’ll start with risks, then a couple of motivations and then list some resources. (my shell will tab complete rm *. I really agree with this one – I’ve been using fish for 10 years and I love it.

Someone recently asked me – “how do you deal with writing in public? People on the internet are such assholes!” I’ve often heard the advice “don’t read the comments”, but actually I’ve learned a huge amount from reading internet comments on my posts from strangers over the years, even if sometimes people are jerks. So I want to explain some tactics I use to try to make the comments on my posts more informative and useful to me, and to try to minimize the number of annoying comments I get.

One of the most fascinating aspects of Tesla&#39;s rise to dominance has been how they discarded many of the traditional values of car making. While the rest of the industry was stuck competing on the size of their panel gaps, and other aspects of precision and quality assembly, Tesla didn&#39;t even show up to participate. Their cars are legendary for being delivered with shoddy paint jobs, rattling interiors, and even mismatched doors . It&#39;s the epitome of Blue Ocean Strategy .

Like exercise, it&#39;s one of those rare avenues of human endeavor that almost invariably will make anyone feel better. And, also like exercise, the hard part is getting started when you need it the most! That&#39;s the curious chasm between knowledge and action. The pretending of purpose.

Many software developers seem to have a uniquely hard time accepting that not everyone who just tries real hard will become so good as to be among the best in this field. That there really is a discrepancy of talent that leads to a discrepancy of competence. That not everyone can or will become equally good at this job. In contrast, nobody seems to have trouble with the fact that not every soccer player who loves the game and trains their best will become eligible for the Premier League. Good.

3D printing is a popular activity among wireless network engineers. Given that they deal with invisible, intangible radio waves all day, maybe it&#39;s no surprise they&#39;d enjoy making things they can touch and feel. On today&#39;s Heavy Wireless we talk about why the wireless community enjoys 3D printing, and how engineers can make and use printed objects on the job--and at home. The post Heavy Wireless 008: 3D Printing For Wireless Engineers appeared first on Packet Pushers .

## [Tech Bytes: Spotting Performance Problems Faster With Digital Experience Monitoring (Sponsored)](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/tech-bytes-spotting-performance-problems-faster-with-digital-experience-monitoring-sponsored/)


Today on the Tech Bytes podcast we get into Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM). DEM goes beyond traditional SLAs by offering more precise measurements of network and application performance as experienced by end users, and can provide detailed measurements to help network engineers identify and respond to problems. We talk with sponsor Fortinet about how it delivers DEM.

Take a Network Break! This week we discuss new charges for IPv4 addresses being levied by AWS, Cisco&#39;s acquisition of a BGP monitoring service, and financial results for a host of tech companies. We also speak with J Metz, the Steering Committee Chair of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium to learn more about the organization&#39;s goals; and examine the efforts to investigate claims of a breakthrough in superconducting research.

On today&#39;s sponsored Heavy Networking we dig into cloud-delivered Secure Web Gateways (SWGs), which help guard end users against Web-based threats and enforce corporate Web access policies. As employees split time between home, office, and who knows where else, and as more applications move online, cloud-based SWGs help connect and protect workers. Our sponsor is Palo Alto Networks.
