#521 – May 08, 2023 Rules of Thumb for Software Development Estimations Ah, software estimation - the bane of many developers’ existence and the scourge of project managers everywhere. A constant battle of “tell me how much it’s going to take you” and “give me a clear description of the task first.” I&#39;m here to bring some much-needed reality of the complexities of real-world development. I’ve had my share of estimations on both sides of the fence. I’ve seen it all.

Posted by Andrew Carroll, Product Lead, and Kishwar Shafin, Research Scientist, Genomics For decades, researchers worked together to assemble a complete copy of the molecular instructions for a human — a map of the human genome . The first draft was finished in 2000, but with several missing pieces. Even when a complete reference genome was achieved in 2022 , their work was not finished. Schematic of a graph genome.

A JWT (JSON Web Token) is a type of security token that is used to securely transmit information between parties. It is a compact and self-contained way of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. Many API providers require you to generate a cryptographically signed JWT assertion that includes the authorization you are requesting from the server. If the server accepts the assertions you are claiming in the JWT, it will respond with an access token granting access to the API.

Starting a new team is an exciting but challenging endeavor, with lots of variables to consider. Splitting teams by fission is the smoothest, optimal way to grow your organization and tackle new problems, and provides a way to create new ownership and growth opportunities. However, creating teams is a delicate art and requires careful balancing of risks to get to an optimal outcome. When you have multiple teams with vague missions, patterns of organizational friction occur.

When working on real-world machine learning (ML) use cases, finding the best algorithm/model is not the end of your responsibilities. It is crucial to save, store, and package these models for their future use and deployment to production. These practices are needed for a number of reasons: To reiterate, while saving and storing ML models…

Today, we’re launching session recording for Tailscale SSH in beta, allowing you to record the terminal output whenever someone on your tailnet initiates a Tailscale SSH connection. You can use these recordings to detect threats, investigate security incidents, and remain compliant with your network security policies. Like all traffic in your tailnet, these streams are encrypted end-to-end, and Tailscale never sees this data. Any owner, admin, or network admin can set up session recording.

Pipelines are a crucial component when building consistent and secure software delivery. A pipeline enables you to set your application&#39;s path to production - from development and testing to production, phases an application will touch on its way there. Weave GitOps Enterprise has recently released a Pipelines feature that enables you to easily define and quickly scale the creation and management of GitOps pipelines. This enables you to push code to production with confidence.

People always talk about “P vs NP” like P problems are easy and NP problems are hard. This is a useful day-to-day model but also an oversimplification. Problems can get way, way harder than NP. (If you want a brief refresher on P and NP, check out my post NP-Complete isn’t (always) Hard .) PSPACE-complete P is the set of all problems that can be solved in polynomial time, relative to the input. PSPACE is the set of all problems that can be solved with polynomial space ...

There are a ton of problems around building LLM apps in production and the last mile of that problem. Travis Fischer, builder of open AI projects like @ChatGPTBot, joins us to talk through these problems (and how to overcome them). He helps us understand the hierarchy of complexity from simple prompting to augmentation, agents, and fine-tuning. Along the way we discuss the frontend developer community that is rapidly adopting AI technology via Typescript (not Python).

It’s easy and intuitive to implement OAuth 2.0 in web applications. However, when setting up OAuth 2.0 for non-web clients this becomes difficult as OAuth 2.0 requires redirect (callback) URLs. Despite this difficulty, it’s possible to create a seamless OAuth 2.0 flow with a great user experience for non-web clients. The Heroku CLI is a great example of such. In this guide, you’ll learn how Heroku CLI works behind the scenes while exploring OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant flow. - auth0.py .
