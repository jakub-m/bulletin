If you work with US government entities or corporations in regulated markets the subject of FIPS compliance may come up, especially in the context of FedRAMP authorization. FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3 are a set of cryptographic standards that your application may need to adhere to dictating the appropriate ciphers or cryptographic functions that are in use.

## [How to Automate ML Experiment Management With CI/CD](https://neptune.ai/blog/automating-ml-experiment-management-with-ci-cd)


ML experiments are, by nature, full of uncertainty and surprises. Small changes can lead to huge improvements, but sometimes, even the most clever tricks don’t yield results. Either way, systematic iteration and exploration are the way to go. This is where things often start getting messy. With the many directions we could take, it’s easy…

The opening keynote to the conference was called &#34;Modern Tradeoff Analysis for Software Architecture&#34;. It was mostly about the factors that went into whether you should split up services into microservices and glue them together. Instead of &#34;X is faster, Y uses less space&#34;, we can say &#34;X uses more space, Y is slower.  ↩

And a battery that needed recharging.

## [Slow Living Is Nothing New.](https://www.carlpullein.com/blog/slow-living-is-nothing-new/5/6/2024)


Imagine starting the day like Charles Darwin, with a leisurely walk in the woods. Or take a cue from Leonardo Da Vinci, who often spent days exploring the countryside outside Florence. And what about Ian Fleming, who would kick off his mornings with a refreshing swim in the sea when he was in Jamaica every January and February? These are all examples of slow living in action. YouTube is full of videos on “Slow Living” these days . Slow living is simple. It’s about living a balanced life .

## [De hele overheid naar de cloud? Dat is een politiek besluit.](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/de-hele-overheid-naar-de-cloud-dat-is-een-politiek-besluit/)


De hele korte versie: stilletjes maar in hoog tempo verhuizen cruciale ICT-diensten binnen de Nederlandse overheid naar met name Microsoft-servers onder Amerikaans recht. Dit neemt zulke enorme vormen aan dat de ICT-kennis binnen de Nederlandse overheid, maar ook binnen Nederland zelf, snel afkalft. Ook is deze beweging dodelijk voor onze eigen Europese industrie, waardoor we straks echt geheel hulpeloos zijn. De overheid mag volgens eigen beleid weloverwogen naar de cloud verhuizen.

If you’ve deployed an AI model to a remote device before, then you’ll know that connecting to it and keeping it secure aren’t exactly easy. Existing edge device tooling from cloud providers has been built around entirely different workloads, focused mostly on streaming low bandwidth sensor data to a centralized location. For more complex AI workloads, edge deployments lack most of the mature connectivity, security, and orchestration tooling available in a typical public cloud region.

Linux can look and feel so good, but it often doesn&#39;t out of the box. It&#39;s almost like there&#39;s a rite of passage in certain parts of the community where becoming an expert in the intricacies of every tool and its theming is required to prove you&#39;re a proper nerd. I think that&#39;s a bit silly, so I created Omakub: An opinionated web developer setup for Ubuntu . Omakub turns a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command.

When Ruby on Rails was launched over twenty years ago, I was a twenty-some young programmer convinced that anyone who gave my stack a try would accept its universal superiority for solving The Web Problem. So I pursued the path of the crusade, attempting to convert the unenlightened masses by the edge of a pointed argument. And for a long time, I thought that&#39;s what had worked. But I was wrong. It wasn&#39;t the crusade that did it. That&#39;s what did it. Others still will find their spirit in Go.
