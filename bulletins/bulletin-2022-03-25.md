The horrors of the Russian war on Ukraine continue unabated. Every eurocent we send to Russia is an intolerable assault on the senses. The world buys lots of things from Russia. For some of these, if Europe does not buy them, someone else will. But there is one major exception: natural gas. Over the past few weeks I’ve been automating graphs that show, on an hourly basis, just how much gas we buy from Russia:

Programmers often need to write data structures to disk or to networks. The data structure then needs to be interpreted as a sequence of bytes. Regarding integer values, most computer systems adopt “little endian” encoding whereas an 8-byte integer is written out using the least significant bytes first. In the Go programming language, you can … Continue reading Writing out large arrays in Go: binary.Write is inefficient for large arrays

## [Avoiding Common Protobuf’s Pitfalls with Buf](https://earthly.dev/blog/buf-protobuf/)


Introduction Welcome back! In my tutorial series on building an Activity Tracker , I built up a client and server communicating over gRPC. I then added REST endpoints to it using the gRPC-Gateway protoc plugin. The plugins like gRPC-gateway and OpenAPI helped make me productive, but my protoc call grew from a simple invocation to a multi-line script, which brought buf to my attention. buf is a suite of tools that simplify dealing with protocol buffers wrapped up in a nice three-letter command...

Coding interviews have never been popular in the programming community; I mean, they are prevalent, since many companies still use them to filter candidates, but they are vastly unpopular in the community because people find them too hard, too unfair, too unrepresentative of reality and so on. There are viral stories all around - like when the creator of Homebrew failed Google&#39;s interviews [1] . In this post I want to make the case that coding interviews aren&#39;t all that bad.

Hello! Recently I’ve been thinking about how I find it fun to learn computer networking by implementing working versions of real network protocols. And it made me wonder – I’ve implemented toy versions of traceroute , TCP and DNS . What about TLS? Could I implement a toy version of that to learn more about how it works? I asked on Twitter if this would be hard, got some encouragement and pointers for where to start , so I decided to go for it.3’s design.ulfheim.3 RFC for a few small things.net).

Amazon Aurora is a high-throughput cloud-native relational database. I will summarize its design as covered by the Sigmod 17 and Sigmod 18 papers from the Aurora team. Aurora uses MySQL or PostgreSQL for the database instance at top, and decouples the storage to a multi-tenant scale-out storage service.  In this decoupled architecture, each database instance acts as a SQL endpoint and supports query processing, access methods, transactions, locking, buffer caching, and undo management.e.e.

Express is a fantastic framework to build APIs. However, when you want to build something more than just a simple small CRUD, you need to think about creating a sturdy and clean architecture. Because Express is not opinionated (which is great), you need to design this architecture by yourself. Maybe you don’t even want to know anything about the app instance inside the module where you implement your routes. We will do that by leveraging Typescript decorators. Basically, there’s no app.json.e.e.

If you’re a high growth company, it’s imperative to find ways to expand. The market rewards growth, and the power law dynamics of startup outcomes (i.e. most value accrues to the winners) mean that growing fast and winning your market carries outsized rewards. Many teams approach the question of how to expand their business as a free-form brainstorming exercise. But in my opinion, this is the wrong approach.

Posted by Boris Babenko, Software Engineer and Naama Hammel, Clinical Research Scientist, Google Health Three years ago we wrote about our work on predicting a number of cardiovascular risk factors from fundus photos (i.e., photos of the back of the eye) 1 using deep learning . That such risk factors could be extracted from fundus photos was a novel discovery and thus a surprising outcome to clinicians and laypersons alike.

Microsoft and identity management platform Okta both disclosed this week breaches involving LAPSUS$, a relatively new cybercrime group that specializes in stealing data from big companies and threatening to publish the information unless a ransom demand is paid. Here&#39;s a closer look at LAPSUS$, and some of the low-tech but high-impact methods the group uses to gain access to targeted organizations.

By using automation judiciously, you can develop and update your applications faster and with reduced investment. Here’s how. You can’t automate everything. That’s because there are some things that need human brain power – everyone knows that. But identifying the best candidate processes isn’t always easy. In this article, we explain how GitOps can be used to automate much of the routine tasks involved in software delivery, saving you money without risk. Neither is particularly appealing.

## [Benefits of scheduling continuous integration pipelines](https://circleci.com/blog/benefits-of-scheduling-ci-pipelines/)


Scheduling is an integral part of software development practices. Tools for scheduling jobs help development teams save time by scheduling recurring tasks — like modifying a database or sending out periodic emails — for execution at specified times. There are many to choose from, including cron for Linux, scheduled tasks for Windows, launchd for macOS, Jobber, and anacron. In most cases, a user writes a script with setup instructions, and a command executes the script at the designated time.

To supervise the behavior of distributed applications and track the origin of service failures and downtime, developers often use traditional monitoring technologies and tools. However, this approach can fall short in its ability to measure the overall health of modern cloud-native architectures, which can span multiple hosting environments and encompass hundreds of microservices. Observability encompasses both the software components themselves and the data traveling between them.

Have you ever wondered where the time goes during a &#34;laptop&#34; coding interview? This is one of those things where you bring in your own little laptop computer (or, they supply one, I guess) and you are expected to solve some problem on the spot. They give you maybe 60-90 minutes to do this, and they want to see it work, and have tests, and all of that good stuff. The interviewer hands you a piece of paper and may or may not discuss it. Then they set you loose and disappear for a while. Joy. Joy..
