## [Imitation Learning](https://geohot.github.io//blog/jekyll/update/2023/11/18/imitation-learning.html)


7 years ago I started comma.ai with a simple idea. Gather tons of human driving data, state action pairs: (S_t, A_t) Train a supervised model f(S_t) -&gt; A_t Drive cars with that model. The exact original formulation was a model that predicts steering angle from image, then used a PID loop to bring the wheel to that desired angle. f_steerangle(img_t) -&gt; steerangle_t This turns out not to work, it couldn’t even drive straight on highways. (f_steerangle(img_t) - α*f_lane(img_t).........

## [Exploring a Postgres query plan](http://notes.eatonphil.com/2023-11-19-exploring-a-postgres-query-plan.html)


I learned this week that you can intercept and redirect Postgres query execution. You can hook into the execution layer so you&#39;re given a query plan and you get to decide what to do with it. What rows to return, if any, and where they come from. That&#39;s very interesting. So I started writing code to explore execution hooks. However, I got stuck interpreting the query plan. Either there&#39;s no query plan walking infrastructure or I just didn&#39;t find it.g. It isn&#39;t text anymore.c . In pgexec.2.2.0.0..

Although the introduction of physical backups in Percona Backup for MongoDB (PBM) made it possible to significantly cut the restore time for big datasets, it’s hard to beat snapshots in speed and efficiency. That’s why we introduced external backups (aka snapshot-based backup API) in PBM 2.2.0The idea came from the requests to bring EBS snapshots […]

Hello! I’ve been working on writing a zine about git so I’ve been thinking about git branches a lot. I keep hearing from people that they find the way git branches work to be counterintuitive. an intuitive model of a branch Of course, people have many different intuitions about branches. Here’s the one that I think corresponds most closely to the physical “a branch of an apple tree” metaphor. So in our picture above both branches ( main and branch ) have 4 commits on them. You just have to know.

This paper is from HotOS&#39;23. At 6 pages, it is an easy-to-read paper, but it is not an easy-to-agree-with paper. The message is controversial: Don&#39;t do microservices, write a monolith, and our runtime will take care of deployment and distribution. This is a big claim, and we have been burned by ambitious attempts like this many times before. I realize big claims are part of the style of HotOS, where work-in-progress and sometimes provocative papers make a debut to kickstart a discussion.....

One of the most problematic setups in any organization is the installation of managers with weak power: Individuals who are given the responsibilities of management but who actually cannot wield them, because their power is weak and in name only. This is not uncommon. This, in turn, lures the weak power into trying to take disciplinary action.” Or, if you have a weak-power board, investors need to be clear that they will be involved in all final decisions.

by Jun He , Yingyi Zhang , and Pawan Dixit Incremental processing is an approach to process new or changed data in workflows. The key advantage is that it only incrementally processes data that are newly added or updated to a dataset, instead of re-processing the complete dataset. This not only reduces the cost of compute resources but also reduces the execution time in a significant manner. When workflow execution has a shorter duration, chances of failure and manual intervention reduce.g.g.e.

Recently, I am thinking quite a bit about engineering strategy, and as part of that have started re-reading previous resources on the topic, and looking for new things to read while I refine my point of view on what makes for good engineering strategy. The best introduction to my current theory of engineering strategy is Solving the Engineering Strategy Crisis , which has both written and video versions. You can also reading my other strategy writing via the strategy tag .g.

Technology Strategy Patterns by Eben Hewitt is a methods-based approach to engineering strategy, with a particular focus on the methods wielded by McKinsey consultants, software engineering mainstays like Thoughtworks, and philosophy. A valuable read for anyone looking to build their own theory of engineering strategy. In June, 2019, I bought a copy of Technology Strategy Patterns by Eben Hewiit.

The Software Engineer’s Guidebook by Gergely Orosz is a broad reference book for software engineers that will be particularly valuable for new software engineers and those who’ve worked most of their career in a small number of companies. It doesn’t go deep everywhere, but leaves a breadcrumb on most topics you’ll encounter as a software engineer, along with enough detail to guide deeper exploration in other, narrower books. Narrowing that gap for newer engineers is valuable.

The Value Flywheel Effect is a worthwhile read. It’s imperfect, but a fascinating look into real-world application of Wardley mapping, and a rare view of a company’s engineering strategy. I’m currently diving into the topic of engineering strategy , and a sub-topic that I’ve not previously spent much time on is Wardley maps . First and foremost, I think this is a very interesting book and worth reading if you’re trying to build a holistic point of view on engineering strategy.g.

What you can’t understand or even explain, doesn’t make it to production.g.2f}&#34;.
