## [Retrieval Augmented Generation in Go](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/retrieval-augmented-generation-in-go/)


I&#39;ve been reading more and more about LLM-based applications recently, itching to build something useful as a learning experience. In this post, I want to share a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system I&#39;ve built in 100% Go and some insights I learned along the way. Some limitations of current LLMs Let&#39;s take OpenAI&#39;s API as an example; for your hard-earned dollars, it gives you access to powerful LLMs and related models. Read on to see how it works.21 this summer .20.g. 2. 3.r.t.

In that meeting, the exec sees the first slide’s first sentence summary and says “oh ok, thanks, no need for a whole presentation.

Envoy Proxy is a well known proxy load balancer offering HTTP, gRPC, TCP, customizable with Lua, Go, WASM … It’s often the core component used to build gateways/proxies for Kubernetes. For example Istio is using it as a proxy load balancer for ingresses but also as a sidecar to create a “mesh network”. Envoy Gateway is a more recent project to manage Envoy proxies inside Kubernetes, it is meant to be a common foundation to build on top of it, but it can be used directly as it is.

Let&#39;s send off the 6x era with something silly. Some physical units of measure, like timestamps, can be subtracted but not added. What does it mean to add 2 PM to 6 PM? That makes no sense. But you can subtract 2 PM from 6 PM and get 4 hours. All things where finding the sum isn&#39;t sensible but finding the difference is.  ↩

Hi, we’re back to talk about performance. You might remember us from our previous work ( post #1 &amp; post #2 ), which increased TCP throughput over wireguard-go , the userspace WireGuard ® implementation that Tailscale uses. We’re releasing a set of changes that builds on this foundation, significantly improving UDP throughput on Linux. As with the previous work, we intend to upstream these changes to WireGuard. These properties make UDP appropriate for real-time applications, e.g.54.36 and v1.31.

This way, I don&#39;t have to visit the library the next time I want to watch it. (I&#39;m still on the Library&#39;s waiting list for the Barbie movie.

By Abhinaya Shetty , Bharath Mummadisetty This blog post will cover how Psyberg helps automate the end-to-end catchup of different pipelines, including dimension tables. In the previous installments of this series, we introduced Psyberg and delved into its core operational modes: Stateless and Stateful Data Processing . Now, let’s explore the state of our pipelines after incorporating Psyberg.g., Active/Upgraded/Downgraded/Canceled. Signups b. Account Plans Create one stateful fact table: a. 1.

 To uncover the magic of audio soundtracks and further improve the sonic experience, we need a way to systematically examine the interaction of these components, typically categorized as dialogue, music and effects . Like semantic segmentation for audio, SMAD separately tracks the amount of speech and music in each frame in an audio file and is useful in content understanding tasks during the audio production and delivery lifecycle. Let’s have a look at a few applications.g.

## [Team Charters are a trap.](https://lethain.com/team-charters/)


I’m cleaning out old lingering drafts. This one’s on why I dislike Team Charters. Recently an email came in asking about writing team charters. I’ve worked at a number of companies that asked teams to write charters, and I think it’s an interesting project. That said, it’s not a project I’d generally prioritize. If you pushed me on this topic, I’d probably suggest you write an engineering strategy document from the perspective of your team.

## [Benchmarking.](https://lethain.com/benchmarking/)


Many of the most important questions for running an organization don’t have clear answers. In most engineering organizations, both the teams working on infrastructure and the teams working on product feel they are undersized. It’s also true that most individuals feel they are undercompensated. In the boom times, there is often enough investor money laying around to say yes to all these questions, but many leaders are acutely learning the long-term costs of expanding our budget too far.

One piece of flippant commentary that you’ll hear occasionally is that it’s “Better to be lucky than to be good.” On an individual level, it’s almost certainly true that being very lucky outperforms being quite good: I certainly know a number of folks who are financially successful after working at companies that succeeded, but where their direct impact was relatively small. Companies get lucky, too. There’s nothing wrong with getting lucky; rather there’s quite a lot right about getting lucky.
