For example, in what follows I will state that climate has always been changing, and has in fact never been stable for very long.

Posted by Greg Corrado, Head of Health AI, Google Research, and Yossi Matias, VP, Engineering and Research, Google Research Medicine is an inherently multimodal discipline. When providing care, clinicians routinely interpret data from a wide range of modalities including medical images, clinical notes, lab tests, electronic health records, genomics, and more. The common mnemonic example of tool use is teaching an LLM to use a calculator rather than do arithmetic on its own.

We’ve previously discussed integer barriers , integer queues , and integer wait groups as tiny concurrency utilities. Next let’s tackle “once” initialization, i.e. pthread_once , using an integer. We’ll need only three basic atomic operations — store, load, and increment — and futex wait/wake. It will be zero-initialized and the entire source small enough to fit on an old-fashioned terminal display. The interface will also get an overhaul, more to my own tastes.........

Introduction Go’s most important data structure is the slice and it was designed from the beginning to be mechanically sympathetic with the hardware. To learn more about that, check out Bill Kennedy’s Ultimate Go video. Thanks to the introduction of generics in Go 1.18, the language team has been experimenting with a new package called slices. This package provides an API that provides various functions that are useful when working with slices.

## [Why is DNS still hard to learn?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/07/28/why-is-dns-still-hard-to-learn/)


I write a lot about technologies that I found hard to learn about. A while back my friend Sumana asked me an interesting question – why are these things so hard to learn about? Why do they seem so mysterious? For example, take DNS. We’ve been using DNS since the 80s (for more than 35 years!). It’s used in every website on the internet. And it’s pretty stable – in a lot of ways, it works the exact same way it did 30 years ago. For example musl DNS didn’t support TCP until early 2023 .8.8.com.net.

By Bent Christensen, Principal Cloud Engineer I, Cloud by McKinsey This article explores how GraphQL can be used to implement a fully event-driven cloud architecture — in the sense that it is comprised of decoupled scalable services in the backend but also extends to the frontend where events can be received in a pub/sub manner. This avoids a clunky and wasteful polling mechanism or, worse, the need for constant refreshes by the end user to get the latest updates.js, for example.urlEncode(JSON..

The Go Blog Experimenting with project templates Cameron Balahan 31 July 2023 When you start a new project in Go, you might begin by cloning an existing project. That way, you can start with something that already works, making incremental changes instead of starting from scratch. For a long time now, we have heard from Go developers that getting started is often the hardest part. Try it out, tell us what you think , and help us build a more useful tool for everyone. For example: $ gonew golang.

## [Manage your priorities and energy.](https://lethain.com/frameworks-decision-making/)


Back when I was managing at Uber, I latched onto a thinking tool that I drilled into the teams I worked with: reach the right outcomes by prioritizing the company first, your team second, and yourself third. This “company, team, self” framework proved a helpful decision-making tool, and at the time I felt it almost always led to the correct decision. As I’ve become a more experienced manager, I’ve stopped giving this advice. Those engineers would slowly become deenergized and frustrated. Great.

Image generated by OpenAI DALL.E 2 Optimizing large systems is incredibly satisfying. Very few things are more exciting than seeing a large baseline shift in your metrics after a clever new algorithm is deployed. Optimization can save money, make systems easier to operate, improve developer productivity, or sometimes unlock scale that wouldn’t be possible otherwise. I have written some medium posts in the past about load-balancing optimizations. Now, let’s consider a different solution.g.

What does it take to be a more effective communicator? According to Dan Lyons, it starts with knowing when to shut your mouth. As a journalist, author, and screenwriter, Lyons knows a thing or two about wielding words. But as he reveals in his book, STFU: The Power of Keeping Your Mouth Shut in an Endlessly Noisy World , most of us talk too much and listen too little. “A great conversation is about listening. And it probably involves you talking less,” he says. More Resources https://www.amazon.

Enterprises stepping up from DevOps to DevSecOps by adding continuous security validations to their CI/CD pipelines is not news. This model has been largely successful in securing applications at an early stage so that production releases have minimal vulnerabilities and defects. And while it has several long-term benefits for the product, developers often tend to overlook the security aspect in the development processes.

We recently rebuilt the Replit filetree with a focus on performance and accessibility. The result? Quicker interactions when exploring large projects and a more accessible experience with improvements like keyboard navigation. Here’s a summary of how the new filetree works. In the early days of Replit, it served as a simple but powerful editor and console. As our user base grew and their projects became more complex, we understood the need for a filesystem and, consequently, a filetree.
