                        “OH GAWD” Around the time of the subprime mortgage collapse, I was working in an enterprise software company. I worked in a large open space full of cubicles. Several times a week, I would hear a slightly panicked voice say, “oh god!” It was always the same voice, and always said in the same way: “OH GAAAHWD”. I don’t think it was said loudly, but it had this tone of distress that always caught my ear. That was Alex 1 , and she wasn’t watching the stock market. But the software was a bit ugly.

                        Serial, Parallel, and Quorum Latencies Why are they letting me write Javascript? I&#39;ve written before about the latency effects of series (do X, then Y), parallel (do X and Y, wait for them both), and quorum (do X, Y and Z, return when two of them are done) systems. The effects of these different approaches to doing multiple things are quite intuitive. What may not be intuitive, though, is the impact of quorums, and how much quorums can reduce tail latency. runs How many times to sample.0` (i.e.

                        I don’t like the word mentor . The word mentor (and its companions mentoring and mentorship ) have too many misconceptions and pretense. They’re big, emotional, life-changing words. They leave would-be-mentees overthinking how to find a mentor and leave would-be-mentors overthinking both how to be a mentor and whether they could be one. When you search for mentor on the popular search engine Google, images of Yoda and Gandalf show up. Then, if you think they can answer some more, ask them again.

                        Engineer onboarding: two perspectives Before I joined the security industry, I was an end user. Coming in with that first-hand experience equips me to talk about secure remote access from multiple perspectives: as a vendor and as a practitioner. This lets me see the technologies available and also understand the drivers and issues engineering orgs face adopting them, particularly with onboarding engineers.

                        Being a better listener has a lot to do with silence, says Collins Dobbs, a lecturer in management at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “A lot of people are uncomfortable with the smallest modicum of silence, but learning often happens when we create distance for useful reflection.   “There’s often a lot more focus on the skill set on delivering emotion than receiving emotion, but if the receiver of emotion can put themselves in a place of curiosity, agency, and openness. . . .

                        The world doesn’t need more words about remote meetings. So here’s a picture: Tailscale is fully remote. And remote meetings suck. We were inspired by Chelsea Troy’s insights into remote meetings , but our attempts at meeting moderation never stuck. It morphed into a culture of raising hands and preferring awkward silences to people talking over each other. That was good. Even better was what happened in some of our Teamflow meetings. It works exactly like you’d expect. Simple.

                        Interest in differential privacy is growing rapidly. As evidence of this, here’s the result of a Google Ngram search [1] on “differential privacy.” When I first mentioned differential privacy to consulting leads a few years ago, not many had heard of it. Now most are familiar with the term, though they may not be clear […] The post What’s “differential” about differential privacy? first appeared on John D. Cook .

                        Originally, React mainly used class components, which can be strenuous at times as you always had to switch between classes, higher-order components, and render props.

                        When running a cloud service, it’s never good for customers to be the first people noticing an issue. It happened to our customers over the course of a few months, and we began to accumulate a series of reports of unpredictable start-up times for Docker jobs. At first the reports were rare, but the frequency began to increase. Jobs with high parallelism were disproportionately represented in the reports. To begin, we looked at the specific jobs where the issue was being reported. Here’s why.....

                        I’ve been leading software teams for more than 20 years and one thing I’ve learned about metrics is that leaders tend to put too much emphasis on engineering metrics alone, without considering the bigger picture. Velocity metrics Engineering velocity metrics measure the speed and efficiency of software delivery pipelines — it’s the metric category that managers typically pay the most attention to. When it comes to throughput, his engineers optimize for the team rather than the individual.

                        Here’s a common situation that plagues many development teams. You run an application through your CI/CD pipeline and all of the tests pass, which is great. But when you deploy it to a live target environment the application just does not function as expected. You can’t always predict what will happen when your application is pushed live. They also ensure that the application will function as expected in a deployed scenario. The full source code can be found in this repo . version: 2.0.8.8.0.8..

                        It’s often necessary to inject secrets into your build or deployment process so that the deployed service can interact with other services. This can be straightforward if you’re only deploying to a single environment. When deploying to multiple environments, though, you might need to dynamically inject different secrets depending on the environment to which you’re deploying. Say you have a virtual machine (VM) that is part of your application.

They start by re-creating the 60 seconds Y Combinator pitch, and then shift focus to what it was like to get EchoesHQ off the ground. Let’s hear why EchoesHQ might just be a great way of addressing this.

Their lab seeks out problems that matter in African communities, pairs those problems with appropriate data/tools, and works with the end users to ensure that solutions create real value.

                        Matteo Collina, Ph.D takes us to school on all things Node, Fastify, and Pino. We start with his journey into the Node community, how he got started in open source, and his experience as a member of Node’s Technical Steering Committee (TSC). We then nerd out about middleware architecture, data structures and logs (yes, logs), and of course, we dive into what makes Fastify so darn fast and how Pino was the precursor project.

                        Over the last few years, Zero Trust, a term coined by Forrester, picked up a lot of steam. Zero Trust, in its core, is a network architecture and security framework focusing on not having a distinction between external and internal access environments, and never trusting users/roles.

                        A challenge with measuring and comparing network performance is the lack of large-scale global performance metrics, like RTT measurements. In this article we describe an alternative approach to active measurements, which accurately predicts network latencies using only passively collected data.
