Companies I’ve worked at during the past 7 years have all used Kubernetes in some way; and the last one, Turbine.ai, adopted it with my lead. The tech was fresh and all backend engineers at our company were pretty hyped about migrating to GKE from Heroku.fluxcd...

I&#39;ve reflected a lot on why that is and I have many complex thoughts on it, but they&#39;re hard to communicate well in a way that doesn&#39;t come across as griping, and that is not how I feel about it overall.

## [Tailscale: A modern replacement for Hamachi](https://tailscale.com/blog/hamachi/)


When I was in college almost a decade ago, I lived on the computer science floor of my dorm. It was quite possibly one of the most interesting places I’ve ever lived. It was full of nerds, and we had file shares and LAN parties every weekend. While I was there, I got introduced to a tool called Hamachi that we used in order to keep playing games like Minecraft, StarCraft (Brood War), and Age of Mythology together over winter and summer breaks. It was a fantastic thing in practice. That was it.0.

This is the first in a series of posts about hiring. While some of this content might seem obvious to experienced recruiters, these are all pieces of advice that we didn’t know when we got started in the industry. We’ve spent countless hours discussing topics around building and scaling companies over the years, but the single topic that we’ve probably spent the most on is hiring. AWS doesn’t stop when it runs out of servers, it stops when you run out of money. Time spent in each stage above.

This is part 16 of a series about my experiences being a parent. Read the rest here . I always assumed that I’d teach my kids about the things that I love, and that I’d start early. Gaby thought the same, and recently we’ve been putting more effort into guiding and challenging Oscar. At first this felt awkward and embarrassing. We worried that trying to teach maths and chess to a three year old might be a waste of time or harmful, or that other people might think we were ridiculous.

Progressive delivery is emerging as a worthy successor to continuous delivery by enabling developers to control how new features are launched to end-users. Its wide popularity is owed to the demand for faster and more reliable software releases. The increasing emphasis on customer experience has made continuous delivery an inadequate methodology. Large enterprises like Netflix, Amazon, and Uber are turning to progressive delivery to test and release code in a phased and controlled manner. 2. 3.

Multicloud is one of the most talked-about ideas in today’s tech landscape. Organizations of various sizes are either dabbling with the idea of multicloud or already running their production workloads on multicloud infrastructure. The popularity of multicloud is largely due to an apprehension towards vendor lock-in, and the need for resilience. Relying on a single public cloud vendor is now a liability for any organization. However, building a seamless multicloud fabric can be very complicated.

Our goal for Autopilot is to support all user workloads (those other than administrative workloads which require privileged access to nodes) so they can be run across the full GKE product. Many workloads, especially those running AI/ML training and inference require GPU hardware.google.wagtailcore.rich_text.google.
