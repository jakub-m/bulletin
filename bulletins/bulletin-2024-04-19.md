For example, 0, 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51... Notation Let&#39;s start with some mathematical notation. We&#39;ll call the underlying function generating the sequence f(n) .....6.

Our computer hardware exchange data using a standard called PCI Express. Your disk, your network and your GPU are limited by what PCI Express can do. Currently, it means that you are limited to a few gigabytes per second of bandwidth. PCI Express is about to receive a big performance boost in 2025 when PCI … Continue reading Science and Technology links (April 13 2024)

We sometimes need to find the greatest common divisor between two integers in software. The fastest way to compute the greatest common divisor might be the binary Euclidean algorithm. In C&#43;&#43;20, it can be implemented generically as follows: template &lt;typename int_type&gt; int_type binary_gcd(int_type u, int_type v) { if (u == 0) { return v; } … Continue reading Greatest common divisor, the extended Euclidean algorithm, and speed!

I never actually cared whether we call it master or main. So when the racialized claims started over how calling the default branch in Git repositories &#34;master&#34; was PrObLEmAtIC, I thought, fine, what skin is it off anyone&#39;s or my back to change? If this is really important, can make a real difference, great. Let&#39;s do it. How naive. This was a classic exploit of good faith, and I fell for it. Changing master to main changed less than nothing. Because nothing was or is ever enough in this arena.

They&#39;re hilariously complicated pieces of engineering that tell time worse than a $20 Casio quartz watch. And that&#39;s why we love them. That&#39;s how computers used to feel too.

## [A guide to scaling OpenTelemetry Collectors across multiple hosts via Ansible](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/04/18/a-guide-to-scaling-opentelemetry-collectors-across-multiple-hosts-via-ansible/)


OpenTelemetry has emerged as a key open source tool in the observability space. And as organizations use it to manage more of their telemetry data, they also need to understand how to make it work across their various environments. This guide is focused on scaling the OpenTelemetry Collector deployment across various Linux hosts to function as both gateways and agents within your observability architecture.1.0 release. Create an Ansible inventory file.190.208.216 # hostname = ubuntu-01 146.190.

## [A guide to scaling Grafana Alloy deployments across multiple hosts](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/04/15/a-guide-to-scaling-grafana-alloy-deployments-across-multiple-hosts/)


Last week we introduced Grafana Alloy , our distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector with built-in Prometheus pipelines and support for metrics, logs, traces, and profiles. We’re excited to see the community embrace Alloy, and we want to help them use and scale it as easily as possible. Many developers that need to deploy and manage software across several hosts turn to Ansible for its ease of use and versatility. We’ll then show you how to explore your data in Grafana.0.0 release.grafana:4.

In fact, Atlas is already back, and better than ever. Now the landscape in the robotics industry is very different.

One of the management guru Peter Drucker ’s most over-quoted turns of phrase is “what gets measured gets improved.” But it’s over-quoted for a reason: It’s true. Nowhere is it truer than in technology over the past 50 years. Moore’s law —which predicts that the number of transistors (and hence compute capacity) in a chip would double every 24 months—has become a self-fulfilling prophecy and north star for an entire ecosystem. Measurement of performance, though, is not limited to chips.

## [What Software Engineers Need to Know About AI Jobs](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-jobs)


AI hiring has been growing at least slightly in most regions around the world, with Hong Kong leading the pack; however, AI careers are losing ground compared with the overall job market, according to the 2024 AI Index Report . This annual effort by Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) draws from a host of data to understand the state of the AI industry today. Stanford’s AI Index looks at the performance of AI models, investment, research, and regulations.

## [15 Graphs That Explain the State of AI in 2024](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-index-2024)


Each year, the AI Index lands on virtual desks with a louder virtual thud—this year, its 393 pages are a testament to the fact that AI is coming off a really big year in 2023. For the past three years, IEEE Spectrum has read the whole damn thing and pulled out a selection of charts that sum up the current state of AI (see our coverage from 2021 , 2022 , and 2023 ). 1.” Another chart in the report shows that most of that private investment in generative AI is happening in the United States. 2. 3.

## [German EV Motor Could Break Supply-Chain Deadlock](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-motor-rare-earth-free)


Among the countless challenges of decarbonizing transportation, one of the most compelling involves electric motors. In laboratories all over the world, researchers are now chasing a breakthrough that could kick into high gear the transition to electric transportation: a rugged, compact, powerful electric motor that has high power density and the ability to withstand high temperatures—and that doesn’t have rare-earth permanent magnets.1 and 3.0 kilowatts per kilogram.

In 2016, the Japanese government announced a plan for the emergence of a new kind of society. Human civilization, the proposal explained, had begun with hunter-gatherers, passed through the agrarian and industrial stages, and was fast approaching the end of the information age. As then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe put it, “We are now witnessing the opening of the fifth chapter.” This chapter, called Society 5.0 , would see made-on-demand goods and robot caretakers , taxis , and tractors.

It’s late in the afternoon of 2 April 2023 on the island of Kauai. The sun is sinking over this beautiful and peaceful place, when, suddenly, at 4:25 pm, there’s a glitch: The largest generator on the island, a 26-megawatt oil-fired turbine, goes offline. This is a more urgent problem than it might sound. The westernmost Hawaiian island of significant size, Kauai is home to around 70,000 residents and 30,000 tourists at any given time.

## [Pogo Stick Microcopter Bounces off Floors and Walls](https://spectrum.ieee.org/jumping-robot-quadrotor)


We tend to think about hopping robots from the ground up. That is, they start on the ground, and then, by hopping, incorporate a aerial phase into their locomotion. But there’s no reason why aerial robots can’t approach hopping from the other direction, by adding a hopping ground phase to flight. Hopcopter is the first robot that I’ve ever seen give this a try, and it’s remarkably effective, combining a tiny quadrotor with a springy leg to hop hop hop all over the place.6 meters to 1.6 meters.
