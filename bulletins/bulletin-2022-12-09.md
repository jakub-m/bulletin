It&#39;s been around 10 years since I worked on Chrome. Here are some stories that have surely been embellished by my own memory over that decade of distance. Treat them all as only maybe 60% true. I figured I could at least write them down before I totally forget them. What I did. I worked on Chrome from the early days, from 2007 to 2012, which just about covers the second half of my twenties. Today it has more than 2.5 billion users. See my first public post there... The Glenhead. In retrospect...

## [Increasing Magic Pocket write throughput by removing our SSD cache disks](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/increasing-magic-pocket-write-throughput-by-removing-our-ssd-cache-disks)


When Magic Pocket adopted SMR drives in 2017, one of the design decisions was to use SSDs as a write-back cache for live writes. The main motivation was that SMR disks have a reputation for being slower for random writes than their PMR counterparts. To compensate, live writes to Magic Pocket were committed to SSDs first and acknowledgements were sent to upstream services immediately. The design worked well for us over the years.5-2 PBs of raw data.5x. There have been other benefits, too.

#501 – December 05, 2022 Cache invalidation really is one of the hardest problems in computer science My colleagues recently wrote a great post on the Netflix tech blog about a tough performance issue they wrestled with. They ultimately diagnosed the problem as false sharing, which is a performance problem that involves caching.

## [Make It Observable: Running Grafana in Docker](https://earthly.dev/blog/running-Grafana-in-Docker/)


When you have a potentially complex infrastructure, adding observability helps with easier debugging and performance optimization. To build observability into the infrastructure, you can use Grafana , an open-source visualization and analytics platform that aids in exploring observability data, such as metrics and logs. You can run Grafana in Docker containers. In this article, you’ll learn more about Grafana, its use cases, and how to implement Grafana in Docker ./grafana.ini:etc/grafana.

Let me say it up front: breaking up end-to-end-encrypted HTTPS connections is bad. No matter why you think that you need to inspect and/or modify the contents of an HTTPS connection, please consider not doing it. And if you still think that you absolutely need it, please sit down and consider again just not doing it. Unfortunately, I know that way too often this advice won’t be followed. Or companies which do it because they want to see everything happening on their network. Let me explain.3.

This one came in a request from a reader. They want to know my feelings about trying to &#34;... avoid a company contributing to the downfall of humanity&#34;. This one&#39;s tough, particularly given my own history. I worked for a web hosting company that had a dubious history of keeping spammers around far too long. Then while I was there, they had the so-called &#34;adware&#34; vendor. They got mad if you called it &#34;spyware&#34;. Now, that customer didn&#39;t last forever... Yeah, I actually said that. That whole thing.

Somehow, one of them got mixed up with someone else&#39;s video upload. They were trying to advertise a sports league. They got something else entirely. &#34;... the video was switched to a dolphin swimming in a pool. Crosslinked videos? That&#39;s bad news. ... Someone put &#34;zeus&#34; in the root cause. ...

It&#39;s the usual &#34;dogfooding&#34; thing you hear about sometimes. To that end, they issued a $250 credit every month. You just had to go to a certain internal web page and click a button, and it would credit it to your account. Every time the calendar rolled over to a new month, you could go click it again...

Hello! I’ve been working on a zine about debugging for the last 6 months with my friend Marie , and one of the problems we ran into was figuring out how to explain the right attitude to take when debugging. We ended up writing a short debugging manifesto to start the zine with, and I’m pretty happy with how it came out. Here it is as an image, and as text (with some extra explanations) 1. Inspect, don’t squash When you run into a bug, the natural instinct is to try to fix it as fast as possible.

Fakt, że komputer potrafi wygenerować koherentny tekst, który zawiera fakty, dobrze posługuje się językiem i konstruuje wypowiedzi, które brzmią autorytatywnie jest imponujące. Podobnie z generowaniem obrazów. W wielu przypadkach ich jakość jest tak wysoka , że trudno wyjść ze zdumienia, że autorem jest model AI. Jednak to nie jest jeszcze AGI .

Wczoraj pisałem o sztucznej inteligencji, a dziś o organicznej głupocie. Zastanawiałem się czy o tym pisać bo to w sumie nie jest temat dotyczący technologii. Ale może trochę jest. W czasach “przed internetem” główne media tworzyły pewne spójne narracje, które każdy kto oglądał telewizję z rodziną znał. Dziś gdy każdy domownik ma swój telefon i sam dobiera sobie treści, spójna narracja nie występuje w tym samym stopniu co kiedyś. Na przykład smutny film o holokauście lub wojnie. Polecam.

Najgłupszą opinią przeciwko ChatGPT jest teza, że zabierze prace ludziom. Modele językowe są tak zaprojektowane by generowały tekst, który łatwo jest zrozumieć i przetworzyć człowiekowi. Mają też możliwości pisania kodu, który powstaje w odpowiedzi na żądanie napisane “ludzkim językiem”. Zamiast więc pisać językiem zrozumiałym dla maszyny, mogę poprosić maszynę ludzkim językiem, żeby napisała coś językiem maszyny. To absurd. Piła spalinowa zwiększa produktywność. ChatGPT robi to samo.

## [Performance considerations for loading data into BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/performance-considerations-for-loading-data-into-bigquery/)


Customers have been using BigQuery for their data warehousing needs since it was introduced. Many of these  customers routinely load very large data sets into their Enterprise Data Warehouse. Whether one is doing an initial data ingestion with hundreds of TB of data or incrementally loading from systems of record, performance of bulk inserts is key to quicker insights from the data. All the different file formats are converted into an optimized Columnar format called ‘Capacitor’ inside BigQuery.

For far too long, managing employee expenses has been a time-consuming process that requires manual data entry and reconciliation to bridge the gap between business bank accounts and ERP systems. In the absence of an integrated workflow, finance teams use multiple systems to manage credit card and cash payments, and finding receipts. In most cases, they also lack real-time visibility into company spending. The complexity grows exponentially as businesses expand, especially into new regions.

This is a three-part series of posts, in which we summarize Workflows and service orchestration patterns. In this third and final post, we talk about managing workflow life cycles and the benefits of using Firestore with Workflows.  Use subworkflows and Terraform to manage workflow definitions If you’re not careful, the workflow definitions you create with YAML or JSON can get out of hand pretty quickly. Thankfully, there are other tools, such as Terraform, that can help.
