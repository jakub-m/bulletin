Most tutorials on Go tooling (and probably most other tooling) tend to focus on the happy path - the input code is perfectly valid and contains no errors. This is often a reasonable assumption, because we tend to run tools on existing code bases, and these are likely to compile correctly in their steady state. However, sometimes knowing how to handle errors is important, and good tooling infrastructure will enable that. The full code is available on GitHub . Syntax { ast .CallExpr { . Fun: *ast.

What is Backoff For? Back off man, I&#39;m a scientist. Years ago I wrote a blog post about exponential backoff and jitter , which has turned out to be enduringly popular. I like to believe that it&#39;s influenced at least a couple of systems to add jitter, and become more stable. However, I do feel a little guilty about pushing the popularity of jitter without clearly explaining what backoff and jitter do, and do not do. Here&#39;s the pithy statement about backoff: Backoff helps in the short term.

It started with just one little code change. I&#39;ve been working on a new web service (more on that next month). While creating it, I came across a little feature that I thought should be added to FotoForensics . It isn&#39;t a new analyzer; it&#39;s just (what I think is) a better way to present some of the existing data. Behind the scenes, the FotoForensics service uses a bunch of templates to render components on pages. One of my templates is for generating &#39;tabs&#39;.g., metadata and digest).

Production ready Flutter — apps deploy automation When you work as a mobile Flutter developer, you need to know both ecosystems: Android and iOS.

Thankfully, some tools can make your life a bit easier. However, let’s start with the Android configuration first. By default it is set to “com.example.jks and key.

Posted by Rolf Jagerman and Honglei Zhuang, Software Engineers, Google Research Ranking is a core problem across a variety of domains, such as search engines, recommendation systems, or question answering. As such, researchers often utilize learning-to-rank (LTR), a set of supervised machine learning techniques that optimize for the utility of an entire list of items (rather than a single item at a time). A noticeable recent focus is on combining LTR with deep learning .g., T5X ).g.jit and jax.

## [A Guide to ConfigMap in Kubernetes](https://www.weave.works/blog/kubernetes-configmap)


For years, developers have adopted the practice of separating configuration data from code. As an integral part of the Twelve-FactorApp Methodology , this practice offers many benefits, top of which is application portability and agility. In Kubernetes, ConfigMaps provide that functionality: they exist to separate code and configuration. After all, the configuration can substantially vary across deployment, but code does not. Thus, they are unsuitable for confidential data storage.yaml file.g.

The popularity of multicloud infrastructure has snowballed in recent years. According to CIO magazine by mid 2021, 73% of surveyed enterprises said they were using two public clouds, and 26% were using three or more . But multi-cloud for many means embracing public cloud along with a mix of private clouds, on-premise, and edge. Organizations leveraging public cloud vendors to run their workloads have long been plagued with vendor lock-in. This is especially true in times of economic uncertainty.

One way to tame your email inbox is to get in the habit of using unique email aliases when signing up for new accounts online. Adding a &#34;&#43;&#34; character after the username portion of your email address -- followed by a notation specific to the site you&#39;re signing up at -- lets you create an infinite number of unique email addresses tied to the same account. Aliases can help users detect breaches and fight spam. But not all websites allow aliases, and they can complicate account recovery.

The legal filing cites liberally from an investigation KrebsOnSecurity published in July, which found that identity thieves were able to assume control over existing Experian accounts simply by signing up for new accounts using the victim’s personal information and a different email address.

Let’s say in 2021, you are organizing an in-person event. You need to make sure it’s COVID-safe for everyone attending, so you set up a system in which every person is tested and only allowed in if the results are negative. You had every invitee fill out a form where they shared their negative test results, but you don’t implicitly trust them because they might have been somewhere else in the meantime or come into contact with another infected person.dev

## [Announcing version history support for Cloud-based maps styling](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/announcing-version-history-support-cloud-based-maps-styling/)


For many Google Maps Platform developers, the map is a core part of their user experience that needs to strike a balance between the right look and just the right amount of information. For example, a travel app developer might want to show more restaurants and landmarks while hiding other points of interest that are less relevant to travelers, but they need to experiment to get the ratios just right for their user experience.
