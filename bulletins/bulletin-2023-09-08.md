## [A year after the disastrous breach, LastPass has not improved](https://palant.info/2023/09/05/a-year-after-the-disastrous-breach-lastpass-has-not-improved/)


In September last year, a breach at LastPass’ parent company GoTo (formerly LogMeIn) culminated in attackers siphoning out all data from their servers. The criticism from the security community has been massive. The list goes on. Now this has been almost a year ago. LastPass promised to improve, both as far as their communication goes and on the technical side of things. So let’s take a look at whether they managed to deliver. TL;DR: They didn’t. Rotate K2 ASAP. And this is just wrong.php .de .”

We have previously discussed two ideas related to onboarding and finding impact. The premise of Optimize Onboarding is that you should start doing real work right away when you join a new company. The premise of Build Your Career on Dirty Work is that you should find the unsavory streams of work in an organization because they’re big opportunities. Most software teams have the following: Incidents and incident data Bugs and bug reports On-call rotations and pages Observability tooling (e.g.g.

Since then, a steady trickle of six-figure cryptocurrency heists targeting security-conscious people throughout the tech industry has led some security experts to conclude that crooks likely have succeeded at cracking open some of the stolen LastPass vaults.

This is noteworthy because .US is overseen by the U.S. government, which is frequently the target of phishing domains ending in .US.

Back in late April, I mentioned that I was working on a new book, The Engineering Executive’s Primer , with O’Reilly. I wanted to share a few notes on progress! First, there’s a cover, shown above in this post’s image, and also in the right rail (or bottom footer if you’re reading on a smaller device). I’m quite excited about the cover, which is simple and imperfect. Second, I’ve done a lot of writing. Every one of those is an idea that I intended for the book.g.

Uber’s original performance process was called “T3B3” and was remarkably simple: write the individuals top 3 strengths, and top 3 weaknesses, and share the feedback with them directly in person. There was a prolonged fight against even documenting the feedback, which was viewed as discouraging honesty. On the other side of things, there are numerous stories of spending months crafting Google promotion packets that still don’t get their authors promoted.g. Managers in a sub-organization (e.g.g.g.

I&#39;ve seen a lot of true believers argue for virtues of their favorite paradigms and methods over the decades working in software. And mostly, I look at people with a passionate preference and smile. Isn&#39;t it great that people care so much about their craft that they volunteer to extol the benefits of their favorite tools! Yes it is, but there&#39;s also a fine line between being a passionate evangelist and becoming a dogmatic crusader. It was at times a full-on meltdown. Yuck. I really am.

By all accounts, TypeScript has been a big success for Microsoft. I&#39;ve seen loads of people sparkle with joy from dousing JavaScript with explicit types that can be checked by a compiler. But I&#39;ve never been a fan. Not after giving it five minutes , not after giving it five years. So it&#39;s with great pleasure that I can announce we&#39;re dropping TypeScript from the next big release of Turbo 8. The fact is that I actually rather like JavaScript. Yes, a distant second, but a second none the less.

When things aren&#39;t going well with a new hire, the problem usually falls into one of two categories: competency or engagement. If it&#39;s a problem with engagement – their style of collaboration, their communication, their approach – there&#39;s a good chance you can fix it with some clear feedback. But if the problem is with core competency – their technical skills – you can&#39;t expect to solve that with a stern conversation. But eventually it will be clear, and when it is, you have to act accordingly.
