There have been massive developments in AI in the last decade, and they’re changing what’s possible with software. There’s also been a huge amount of misunderstanding, hype, and outright bullshit. I believe that the advances in AI are real, will continue, and have promising applications in the public sector. But I also believe that there are clear “right” and “wrong” ways to apply AI to public sector problems.

This blog post originally appeared on the LFI blog but I decided to post it on my own as well. Every organization has to contend with limits: scarcity of resources, people, attention, or funding, friction from scaling, inertia from previous code bases, or a quickly shifting ecosystem. And of course there are more, like time, quality, effort, or how much can fit in anyone&#39;s mind.) But this perspective itself is a trap.. They come with stress, adrenalin, and sometimes a sense of panic or shock.

&#34;A City on Mars&#34; By Kelly and Zach Weinersmith - actual discussion of building settlements on Mars occupies maybe 1% of this book. The authors have an uncanny talent of focusing on all the least interesting aspects of space exploration; whatever little is dedicated to science and engineering is fairly shallow and reeks of techno-pessimism. Overall, I found it infuriatingly bad. Just regular people living their lives in Japan; the common theme is changing circumstances and how to deal with them..

We recently received an attitude indicator for the F-4 fighter plane, an instrument that uses a rotating ball to show the aircraft&#39;s orientation and direction. In a normal aircraft, the artificial horizon shows the orientation in two axes (pitch and roll), but the F-4 indicator uses a rotating ball to show the orientation in three axes, adding azimuth (yaw). The &#34;W&#34; forms a stylized aircraft. In this case, it indicates that the aircraft is climbing slightly. Photo from CuriousMarc.space or RSS .

With separate plastic, metal, paper, and glass recycling, composting, and pick up of all the rest, knowing which days to put out which bins can be complicated. Some have turned to high-tech solutions like Darren Tarbard&#39;s wonderful &#34; bindicator &#34;. There&#39;s even a  commercial version  of that. I thought about making something similar, but decided that a high-tech solution isn&#39;t always the right one. Instead I made a clock, or rather a clock face. Something like this . The code is here .0 * math.

## [Slim Reader/Writer Locks are neato](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2024/10/03/)


I’m 18 years late, but Slim Reader/Writer Locks have a fantastic interface: pointer-sized (“slim”), zero-initialized, and non-allocating. Lacking cleanup, they compose naturally with arena allocation . Sounds like a futex? That’s because they’re built on futexes introduced at the same time. They’re also complemented by condition variables with the same desirable properties. My only quibble is that slim locks could easily have been 32-bit objects , but it hardly matters.cpp .dll .

Delta Lake is an open protocol for serverless ACID databases. Due to its simplicity, scalability, and the number of open-source implementations, it&#39;s quickly becoming the DuckDB of serverless transactional databases for analytics workloads. Iceberg is a contender too, and is similar in many ways. But since Delta Lake is simpler (simple != better) that&#39;s where we&#39;ll focus in this post. Delta Lake has one of the most accessible database papers I&#39;ve read ( link ). We must start somewhere.e.......e.

Kamal was our ticket out of the cloud. A simple tool for deploying containerized applications onto our own hardware, without the need for the complexity of something like Kubernetes. Kamal 2 is a huge leap forward for that tool, and it has just shipped.  Now you can deploy multiple applications to the same server, and you can have SSL certificates automatically provisioned via Let&#39;s Encrypt. A big compression in complexity, especially when just getting started. All in under half an hour.

I totally understand how programming conferences end up being held in a drab Sheraton hotel somewhere to save money. It&#39;s expensive to outfit a cool venue with the gear and operations needed to pull off a great experience for speakers, sponsors, and attendees. And while the cost of doing something more inspiring than a carpet-clad conference hotel is clear, the pay off is often fuzzy until you do. But Rails World 2024 in Toronto just made that value crystal clear.

Helmet.js is a Node.js security module I maintain. I just released version 8.0.0, a new major version. There aren’t any new features in this version, just small breaking changes. Because Helmet is a sorta-popular package, I try to keep breaking changes to a minimum. I don’t want developers to have to do a bunch of unnecessary work! The biggest change is either increasing Strict-Transport-Security ’s max age or bumping the minimum Node version to v18.

## [Alles voor de kinderen, maar doe dan wel het juiste](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/alles-voor-de-kinderen-maar-dit/)


De hele korte versie: Om kinderen zo goed mogelijk te beschermen zijn er veel dingen die we onmiddellijk kunnen doen, zoals investeren in oplossen achterstanden bij de politie. Het is juist niet behulpzaam nu de nieuwe EU CSAM-verordening te steunen, want die zal niet daadwerkelijk helpen en voornamelijk meer afleiding veroorzaken.

Organizations that get relieved of credentials to their cloud environments can quickly find themselves part of a disturbing new trend: Cybercriminals using stolen cloud credentials to operate and resell sexualized AI-powered chat services. Researchers say these illicit chat bots, which use custom jailbreaks to bypass content filtering, often veer into darker role-playing scenarios, including child sexual exploitation and rape.

A California man accused of failing to pay taxes on tens of millions of dollars allegedly earned from cybercrime also paid local police officers hundreds of thousands of dollars to help him extort, intimidate and silence rivals and former business partners, a new indictment charges. KrebsOnSecurity has learned that many of the man&#39;s alleged targets were members of UGNazi, a hacker group behind multiple high-profile breaches and cyberattacks back in 2012.

When you investigate an incident, context is everything. Let’s say you’re working on-call and get pinged in the middle of the night. You open the alert and it sends you to a dashboard where you recognize a latency pattern. But is the spike normal for that time of day? Is it even relevant? Next thing you know, you’re expanding the time window and checking other related metrics as you try to figure out what’s going on. It’s not to say you won’t find the answers. Performant at scale. No magic.

In simple terms, containers are a standard package of software that enable applications to run consistently across different computing environments. Often, these applications are broken down into smaller collections of independent services known as microservices. For many organizations, these microservices-based applications have replaced traditional monolithic applications because they offer increased performance, flexibility, and scale. Let’s take a closer look.g.yaml .

When incidents occur, engineers must jump into action to get systems back to running at peak performance. However, there are a myriad of challenges that can prevent them from resolving the issues swiftly. Imagine a scenario where a team of DevOps engineers manages a cloud-based e-commerce platform that experiences occasional spikes in traffic during peak shopping seasons. In scenarios like this, it helps to take a more proactive approach to improve resilience and reliability.e.commonLabels.

How could a machine that complex and delicate be repaired by astronauts wearing 130-kilogram suits with thick gloves? In the end, spacewalkers not only fixed the telescope, they regularly remade it. They increased its electric supply by 20 percent. And they tripled its ability to concentrate and sense light, job one of any telescope.”

This article is part of our exclusive IEEE Journal Watch series in partnership with IEEE Xplore. In space, high-energy gamma radiation can change the properties of semiconductors, altering how they work or rendering them completely unusable. Finding devices that can withstand radiation is important not just to keep astronauts safe but also to ensure that a spacecraft lasts the many years of its mission. Constructing a device that can easily measure radiation exposure is just as valuable.

His thesis was that the United States risked sending a signal to potential aggressors that, faced with conflict, defense officials would have only two choices: settle for peace at any price, or retaliate with thermonuclear ruin. And yet this gaping hole in nuclear response policy persists to this day.
