The Model Why does biological evolution work? And, for that matter, why does machine learning work? Both are examples of adaptive processes that surprise us with what they manage to achieve. So what’s the essence of what’s going on? I’m going to concentrate here on biological evolution, though much of what I’ll discuss is also […]

## [It&#39;s always TCP_NODELAY. Every damn time.](http://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/05/09/nagle.html)


It’s always TCP_NODELAY. Every damn time. It&#39;s not the 1980s anymore, thankfully. The first thing I check when debugging latency issues in distributed systems is whether TCP_NODELAY is enabled. And it’s not just me. Every distributed system builder I know has lost hours to latency issues quickly fixed by enabling this simple socket option, suggesting that the default behavior is wrong, and perhaps that the whole concept is outmoded. First, let’s be clear about what we’re talking about.g.

## [Developing an Aya-rs eBPF application using devcontainers](https://sookocheff.com/post/kubernetes/developing-an-aya-rs-app-using-devcontainers/)


eBPF is a technology allowing you to dynamically program the kernel using a virtual machine approach. Several development frameworks exist, with the top choice for Rust developers being Aya. Because of the deep integration between eBPF and the Linux kernel, it can be challenging to create a local development environment that works across different development machines. To date, I’ve taken to developing eBPF programs on EC2 instances using the AWS Cloud9 development environment.

So you want to lead your team toward innovation. Does that require that you know where you’re going? Not according to Linda Hill . Hill is a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School whose research focuses on leadership and how organizations achieve innovation. When it comes to generating breakthrough ideas, Hill says it’s less about a creative vision and more about stepping into the unknown. “Innovation [is] not about an individual coming up with a new idea,” she says.

Management advice often includes guidance on managing low performance. There is less written about managing high performance. This disparity exists for two reasons: High performance is less common than low performance, because high performers usually get promoted into positions with higher expectations. Underperformance is in every role; high performance gets leveled-up into expectation-meeting performance. Most managers mismanage high performers. Identify places for improvement. P.S.”

In the fast-paced world of technology, it is crucial to ensure that the products we create maintain high quality. This article aims to provide an overview of how we can measure a product’s quality, from understanding what quality means to the various strategies we can use to evaluate and improve it. For instance, considering a jar of tomato sauce, we regard it as high-quality if it satisfies our taste, aligns with our health standards, and has a long shelf life. But don’t be mistaken.

It introduces three main components: Activities, Orchestrations, and Entities. Activities handle side effects and are stateless; Orchestrations manage event-sourced code execution, providing linearity despite non-linear event sequences; Entities maintain core application state and behavior, ensuring synchronous operation.

The U.S. Department of Justice also indicted Khoroshev as the gang&#39;s leader &#34;LockbitSupp,&#34; and charged him with using Lockbit to attack more than 2,000 victims and extort at least $100 million in ransomware payments.

Virtual private networking (VPN) companies market their services as a way to prevent anyone from snooping on your Internet usage. But new research suggests this is a dangerous assumption when connecting to a VPN via an untrusted network, because attackers on the same network could force a target&#39;s traffic off of the protection provided by their VPN without triggering any alerts to the user.

For the last several decades, one avenue of technological progress has towered over nearly everything else: semiconductors. Semiconductors are materials that can have their conductivity varied by many orders of magnitude, which makes it possible to selectively block and allow the flow of electrons. This property makes it possible to manufacture all sorts of electronic devices, not least of which is the digital computer.

Developers use CSS frameworks to reduce boilerplate, increase quality, and drive consistency. However, these gains are hard to maintain as an application’s codebase matures. Developers must configure and override the framework to accommodate changes. Instead of using a CSS framework, developers should write their own custom CSS. CSS has evolved enough that this became the best option. By Tyson Gern

Authenticated users in Grafana have the same permissions as the user configured for the underlying data source.

Connected vehicles offer a range of benefits, such as real-time data sharing, app-to-car connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and critical safety features like location tracking, remote parking, and in-vehicle infotainment systems (IVIs). These advancements aim to enhance the overall driving and riding experience. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that equipping vehicles with smart features also exposes them to potential cyberattacks. What you will learn: 1.

## [A Skeptic’s Take on Beaming Power to Earth from Space](https://spectrum.ieee.org/space-based-solar-power-2667878868)


The accelerating buildout of solar farms on Earth is already hitting speed bumps, including public pushback against the large tracts of land required and a ballooning backlog of requests for new transmission lines and grid connections. Energy experts have been warning that electricity is likely to get more expensive and less reliable unless renewable power that waxes and wanes under inconstant sunlight and wind is backed up by generators that can run whenever needed. The U.S.S.S. [See diagrams..

## [Femtosecond Lasers Solve Solar Panels&#39; Recycling Issue](https://spectrum.ieee.org/solar-panel-recycling)


Solar panels are built to last 25 years or more in all kinds of weather. Key to this longevity is a tight seal of the photovoltaic materials. Manufacturers achieve the seal by laminating a panel’s silicon cells with polymer sheets between glass panes. But the sticky polymer is hard to separate from the silicon cells at the end of a solar panel’s life, making recycling the materials more difficult. Researchers at the U.S. A femtosecond laser welds a small piece of test glass.

Today Dresden, Germany–based startup SpiNNcloud Systems announced that its hybrid supercomputing platform, the SpiNNcloud Platform, is available for sale. The machine combines traditional AI accelerators with neuromorphic computing capabilities, using system-design strategies that draw inspiration from the human brain. Systems for purchase vary in size, but the largest commercially available machine can simulate 10 billion neurons , about one-tenth the number in the human brain.”

A quick glance at the news headlines each morning might convey that the world is in crisis. Challenges include climate-change threats to human infrastructure and habitats; cyberwarfare by state and nonstate actors attacking energy sources and health care systems; and the global water crisis, which is compounded by the climate crisis. Perhaps the biggest challenge is the rapid advance of artificial intelligence and what it means for humanity. ERVA is an initiative of the U.S.G. Wells .

The emergence of artificial general intelligence (AGI)—systems that can perform any task a human can—could be the most important event in human history, one that radically impacts all aspects of our collective lives. Yet AGI, which could emerge soon , remains an elusive and controversial concept. We lack a clear definition of what it is, we don’t know how we will detect it, and we don’t know how to deal with it if it finally emerges. In the case of AGI, matters are far more complicated.
