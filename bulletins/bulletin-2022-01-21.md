Republished from Teleport’s official blog ( link ) Z3 is a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver developed by Microsoft Research. With a description like that you’d expect it to be restricted to esoteric corners of the computerized mathematics world, but it’s made impressive inroads addressing conventional software engineering needs: analyzing network ACLs and firewalls in Microsoft Azure, for example. Anyway, here’s how you’d write this in Python: import z3 solver = z3 . Solver() x = z3 .

If you programmed something and it turns out to be too slow, often you’d like to farm out the work to multiple threads. At this point you typically have a few choices: use some kind of producer/consumer pipe half-ass it by dividing the work into n chunks and launch n threads and hope for the best rely on one of the magic parallelization solutions (#pragma omp) use (newfangled) language features All of these options are painful to some extent.

In programming, we often represent numbers using types that have specific ranges. For example, 64-bit signed integer types can represent all integers between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807, inclusively. All integers inside this range are valid, all integers outside are “out of range”. It is simple. What about floating-point numbers? The nuance with floating-point numbers is that … Continue reading What is the ‘range’ of a number type?

You find gonum, which has some plotting capabilities, but it generates static charts. It’s 2022, and you’d like to have interactive features such as zooming, panning, and more. You turn to the HTML landscape, and see many more options and decide to take this path. After a short survey, you decide to use plotly.

A few days ago, I got to have a delightful chat with Katie Wilde , digging into a question that we’ve both found difficult to answer: what distinguishes managers perceived to have good judgment from those perceived to have bad judgment? In exploring that question, the topic of mental models came up frequently. Mental model is a somewhat overloaded term, but roughly means having a structured view on a given topic. For managers, it’s usually easiest to see in evolving process.

## [Some ways DNS can break](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/01/15/some-ways-dns-can-break/)


When I first learned about it, DNS didn’t seem like it should be THAT complicated. Like, there are DNS records, they’re stored on a server, what’s the big deal? But with DNS, reading about how it works in a textbook doesn’t prepare you for the sheer volume of different ways DNS can break your system in practice. It’s not just caching problems! So I asked people on Twitter for example of DNS problems they’ve run into, especially DNS problems that didn’t initially appear to be DNS problems .64.0.

DynamoDB&#39;s Best Feature: Predictability Happy birthday! It&#39;s 10 years since the launch of DynamoDB , Amazon&#39;s fast, scalable, NoSQL database. Back when DynamoDB launched, I was leading the team rethinking the control plane of EBS . At the time, we had a large number of manually-administered MySQL replication trees, which were giving us a lot of operational pain. Writes went to a single primary, and reads came from replicas, with lots of eventual consistency and weird anomalies in the mix.

My cat is a great communicator. Today, just before noon, he meowed in front of my room. When I opened the door, he walked down the stairs till halfway, stopped, looked back at me, made eye contact, and meowed again. When I started following him, he passed the living room, stopped, looked back at me, meowed again, and waited for me to catch up. He then led me to the kitchen next to his feeder, and made me feed him. Many technical people forget this first rule of communication. Divide and conquer.

At growth companies, complexity kills. The reason is simple - complexity is slow, and slow don’t grow. For example, say the software you’re building has a piece of code that has been optimized for the last 4 years, mostly by one SME. It might run 40% faster than a simpler, less optimized version. But it’s become very complex, and even SME has some trouble keeping all of it in their head at once. One final, critical detail - the code is not bad code. It’s actually very good code.

Posted by Oran Lang and Inbar Mosseri, Software Engineers, Google Research Neural networks can perform certain tasks remarkably well, but understanding how they reach their decisions — e.g., identifying which signals in an image cause a model to determine it to be of one class and not another — is often a mystery . These insights can also be helpful in guiding health care providers, revealing model biases, providing support for downstream decision makers, and even aiding scientific discovery.g.

Kubernetes is open source software for deploying, scaling and managing containerized applications. As an orchestrator, it handles the work of scheduling containers on a cluster and also manages the workloads, to ensure they run as you intended.    Because Kubernetes was designed from the outset with the idea of software development and operations working together, operations tasks and how they get performed represent an integral component of Kubernetes’ architecture and design.

Kubernetes has had a meteoric rise over the past few years as organizations have made the switch to containerized workloads and application infrastructure, leveraging the scalability that Kubernetes offers. Simultaneously, DevOps as a culture has taken off and has become almost the default approach to software development, testing, and deployment, allowing organizations to accelerate the pace at which they deliver applications and services to customers.

The SSH agent ( ssh-agent ) is an SSH key manager that stores the SSH key in a process memory so that users can log into SSH servers without having to type the key’s passphrase every time they authenticate with the server. In addition to the key management feature, SSH agent supports agent forwarding, which helps to authenticate with servers that sit behind a bastion or jump server . However, the more critical security risk is associated with SSH agent forwarding. 1. 2. 3. You can also update .

## [How I found my lost network packets (Ship It! #35)](https://changelog.com/shipit/35)


Today Gerhard shares the entire story behind his lost packets. He is talking with Drew Marshall, director at Trunk Networks and No One Internet, a Cloud Services Provider &amp; ISP based in Sussex, UK. Gerhard’s Vodafone ISP gateway was losing packets, and recording some of the previous episodes used to be challenging as his internet connection would cut out up to 10 seconds at a time, multiple times per recording session. He was convinced that his Unifi Dream Machine Pro was not the issue.

For years, retailers have been told that they must embrace a litany of new technologies, trends, and imperatives like online shopping, mobile apps, omnichannel, and digital transformation. In search of growth and stability, retailers adopted many of these, only to realize that for every box they ticked, there was another one waiting. And then the pandemic hit, along with rising social movements and increasingly harsh weather. The pivot is now a given. What matters is how you do it...

If you manage sensitive data in your MySQL database, you might be obligated to record and monitor user database activity, especially if you work in a regulated industry. Although you could set up MySQL’s slow query log or general log to create an audit trail of user activity, these logs significantly impact database performance and aren’t formatted optimally for auditing. You can now define audit rules that govern which database activity is recorded. Read Article

When an alert fires from your applications, your team needs to know as soon as possible to mitigate any user-facing issues. Customers with complex operating environments rely on incident management or related services to organize and coordinate their responses to issues. They need the flexibility to route alert notifications to platforms or services in the formats that they can accept. You can configure your Google Cloud alerts to be sent to any vendor or custom-built tool used by your team.

Most businesses that have adopted off-site or hybrid working models over the last two years made the change under immense pressure. The need was incredibly urgent and timing was a major factor.

Hybrid and multi-cloud environments produce a boundless array of logs including application and server logs, logs related to cloud services, APIs, orchestrators, gateways and just about anything else running in the environment. Due to this high volume, logging systems may become slow and unmanageable when you urgently need them to troubleshoot an issue, and even harder to use them to get insights. These insights did not need to be real-time., specifically related to their network logs.
