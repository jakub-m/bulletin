NB: This post describes a very casual code review of a few cryptography functions used by MetaMask. It does not describe any vulnerabilities. If you’re the kind of person who likes a meandering and amateurish code review that goes absolutely nowhere, you’ll enjoy this post.

## [Regexes in the Z3 Theorem Prover](https://ahelwer.ca/post/2022-01-19-z3-rbac/)


Republished from Teleport’s official blog ( link ) Z3 is a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver developed by Microsoft Research. With a description like that you’d expect it to be restricted to esoteric corners of the computerized mathematics world, but it’s made impressive inroads addressing conventional software engineering needs: analyzing network ACLs and firewalls in Microsoft Azure, for example. Anyway, here’s how you’d write this in Python: import z3 solver = z3 . Solver() x = z3 .

## [Simple generic parallelism idiom &amp; C&#43;&#43;17 specifics](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/simple-parallelism-idiom/)


If you programmed something and it turns out to be too slow, often you’d like to farm out the work to multiple threads. At this point you typically have a few choices: use some kind of producer/consumer pipe half-ass it by dividing the work into n chunks and launch n threads and hope for the best rely on one of the magic parallelization solutions (#pragma omp) use (newfangled) language features All of these options are painful to some extent.

## [What is the ‘range’ of a number type?](https://lemire.me/blog/2022/01/17/what-is-the-range-of-a-number-type/)


In programming, we often represent numbers using types that have specific ranges. For example, 64-bit signed integer types can represent all integers between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807, inclusively. All integers inside this range are valid, all integers outside are “out of range”. It is simple. What about floating-point numbers? The nuance with floating-point numbers is that … Continue reading What is the ‘range’ of a number type?

When I&#39;m asked &#34;what podcasts do you listen to?&#34;, after an uncomfortable pause I&#39;m forced to answer that &#34;I usually don&#39;t&#34;. The full explanation is almost always too long for a brief friendly chat, but I did manage to articulate it to friends a couple of times in recent history; I think it&#39;s time to put it down in writing. Generally speaking, I prefer Slow Media , and the slower the better. Consuming information is a marathon, not a sprint. Suppose I&#39;m interested in 20 different topics.

Introduction You’d like to visualize some stock data using Go, but after looking at the Go ecosystem you see very little in charting. You find gonum, which has some plotting capabilities, but it generates static charts. It’s 2022, and you’d like to have interactive features such as zooming, panning, and more. You turn to the HTML landscape, and see many more options and decide to take this path. After a short survey, you decide to use plotly.

A few days ago, I got to have a delightful chat with Katie Wilde , digging into a question that we’ve both found difficult to answer: what distinguishes managers perceived to have good judgment from those perceived to have bad judgment? In exploring that question, the topic of mental models came up frequently. Mental model is a somewhat overloaded term, but roughly means having a structured view on a given topic. For managers, it’s usually easiest to see in evolving process.

When I first learned about it, DNS didn’t seem like it should be THAT complicated. Like, there are DNS records, they’re stored on a server, what’s the big deal? But with DNS, reading about how it works in a textbook doesn’t prepare you for the sheer volume of different ways DNS can break your system in practice. It’s not just caching problems! So I asked people on Twitter for example of DNS problems they’ve run into, especially DNS problems that didn’t initially appear to be DNS problems .64.0.

DynamoDB&#39;s Best Feature: Predictability Happy birthday! It&#39;s 10 years since the launch of DynamoDB , Amazon&#39;s fast, scalable, NoSQL database. Back when DynamoDB launched, I was leading the team rethinking the control plane of EBS . At the time, we had a large number of manually-administered MySQL replication trees, which were giving us a lot of operational pain. Writes went to a single primary, and reads came from replicas, with lots of eventual consistency and weird anomalies in the mix.

My cat is a great communicator. Today, just before noon, he meowed in front of my room. When I opened the door, he walked down the stairs till halfway, stopped, looked back at me, made eye contact, and meowed again. When I started following him, he passed the living room, stopped, looked back at me, meowed again, and waited for me to catch up. He then led me to the kitchen next to his feeder, and made me feed him. Many technical people forget this first rule of communication. Divide and conquer.

At growth companies, complexity kills. The reason is simple - complexity is slow, and slow don’t grow. For example, say the software you’re building has a piece of code that has been optimized for the last 4 years, mostly by one SME. It might run 40% faster than a simpler, less optimized version. But it’s become very complex, and even SME has some trouble keeping all of it in their head at once. One final, critical detail - the code is not bad code. It’s actually very good code.

## [How to Use SSH Agent Safely](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-use-ssh-agent-safely/)


The SSH agent ( ssh-agent ) is an SSH key manager that stores the SSH key in a process memory so that users can log into SSH servers without having to type the key’s passphrase every time they authenticate with the server. In addition to the key management feature, SSH agent supports agent forwarding, which helps to authenticate with servers that sit behind a bastion or jump server . However, the more critical security risk is associated with SSH agent forwarding. 1. 2. 3. You can also update .

With a description like that, you’d expect it to be restricted to esoteric corners of the computerized mathematics world, but it has made impressive inroads addressing conventional software engineering needs: analyzing network ACLs and firewalls in Microsoft Azure, for example. Z3 Automata was sadly never open-sourced, but the following years saw a ton of work put into Z3’s string and regex functionality.

Lack of access accountability and unmonitored access create a considerable security risk for organizations, and the best way to mitigate this challenge is by implementing identity-based access.” Identity-based access entails integrating identity providers with access providers with single sign-on (SSO) features to deliver an efficient and secure access method. In this article, we’ll talk about the features and advantages of identity-based access and how it can be used with SSH.
