As part of my coping mechanisms, I like to make graphs of important things I worry about. Recently with the Russia-inflicted horrors in Ukraine, I’ve been looking at the torrent of Russian gas being bought by Europe. This turned into a live plot that shows just how much money we are sending to Russia. In that post, I also dwell on how we are using that gas to heat our houses and generate electricity.

## [The Software Iron Triangle](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/the-software-iron-triangle/)


The “iron triangle” of project management is “Cheap, fast, good: choose two”. This works on the assumption that quality is a metric while time and money are fungible constraints. We can exchange between time and money, and also lower our quality goals to require less of both. Then by LeMond’s law 1 , if you aren’t using much of your resources, you can afford to be more ambitious and put yourself in a place that does demand more from your resources. “Correctness” is the one I’m least sure about.

In most systems, integers are stored using a fixed binary representation. It is common to store integers using 32-bit or 64-bit words. You sometimes need to convert it to a string. For example, the integer 12345 might need to be converted to the five characters ‘12345’. In an earlier blog post, I presented the simpler … Continue reading Converting integers to decimal strings faster with AVX-512

Working with large projects in Gradle can be a pain. As a project grows larger over time, configuration and build times tend to grow with it. Breaking up large projects into lots of modules can help mitigate this, but unless you meticulously follow the seemingly ever-changing advice about project structure and build script configuration, it’s easy to end up with a build system that’s doing far more than it needs to. And while Gradle is doing that extra work, you have to sit and wait.gradle...4..

This post takes a deeper look into how Go compiles method invocations; specifically, how it compiles interface method invocations. Many online descriptions of this process are outdated, because the Go compiler has switched to a new, register-based ABI in the 1.17 release for AMD64. Go 1.18 enabled the register-based ABI for additional architectures , but this post will focus on AMD64. This code represents the inner loop of Bubble sort : func bubbleUp ( x sort .

This means we often run into the situation where my team made certain decisions or commitments months ago, which we are being held to now. However, almost no-one who made that decision is still around. Perhaps what we need is a versioning system for teams. This is how it could work 3 : MAJOR version when you a team member leaves, joins or a title changes. Let’s work through an example.0.

GitOps and Security GitOps, by its nature, provides an auditable, secure, and regulatory compliant method to manage deployments. In the GitOps framework, Git is at the heart of software delivery pipelines. Every piece of software pushed to the Git repository unleashes a series of automated events, leading to tested, vetted, approved code being deployed into production. With access policies declared in a config file, you know who has access to what – and can easily verify it in code.

Imagine that you provisioned a Terraform resource in your environment running on a public cloud, such as Google Cloud , and you need to destroy and recreate the resource so you can start from a clean state.  Terraform gives you two tools to accomplish this: The terraform taint command, which instructs Terraform to mark an object as tainted in the Terraform state. When an object is marked as tainted, Terraform will propose to replace it. (This command is considered deprecated.google. 2. 3. 4.

One of the hopeful signs of a return to normalcy is seeing many of our customers make plans to come back into their offices. And they’re asking for strategies that will make hybrid work a more equitable and productive experience for everyone. At Google, we’re also beginning our own transition to hybrid work in early April. As we gear up for that, it feels like a time of optimism for new ways of working together and the potential for hybrid models to become the sustainable norm.

In this blog we’ll be visiting the topics of IP addresses and subnetting on Google Cloud. IP addressing and subnetting can be confusing to many, but addressing is a very important requirement in your network. An IP address is a unique identifier for a network and a host. To separate an IP address into network and host segments a subnet mask is used. You can compare this to a city block which has a street and buildings with numbers. One street may have many buildings on it. e.g 192.168.10.168. E.

Apache Spark has become a popular platform as it can serve all of data engineering, data exploration, and machine learning use cases. However, Spark still requires the on-premises way of managing clusters and tuning infrastructure for each job. This increases costs, reduces agility, and makes governance extremely hard; prohibiting enterprises from making insights available to the right users at the right time.

How many times has a shopper searched for a product on a store’s website only to get results that aren’t relevant—or worse, provided no search results at all? While most ecommerce sites have search capabilities, few accomplish their ultimate goal: making it easy for customers to discover the products they want.  Some 94% of U.S. consumers abandoned a shopping session because they received irrelevant search results, according to a 2021 survey conducted by The Harris Poll and Google Cloud.S.

One does not simply productionalize machine learning models. If you’ve developed models before, you know that most of the time input features need to be preprocessed before they are ready to be consumed by a model. Often this preprocessing step is done by another application before sending the processed output to the prediction engine. This adds a layer of complexity when productizing machine learning models and makes integrations difficult. Download a model from TensorFlow Hub On https://tfhub.
