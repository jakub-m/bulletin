Hello, and welcome to this presentation on who controls the internet, and if they actually should. As you can see, I cover all grounds here. All kinds of flags are in this presentation and all kinds of companies.

                        <div class="description">
                        Bash is not just a UNIX shell, it’s also a programming language. And like most programming languages, it has variables. You use these shell variables whenever you append to your PATH or refer to $HOME or set JAVA_HOME . So let me walk you through how variables work in bash, starting with local shell variables and then covering special and environment variables. I think you’ll find understanding the basics to be extremely helpful. You can see this at any time by running set ...2)./bash./cli1. &gt; .

                        Posted by Johan Ferret, Student Researcher, Google Research, Brain Team An approach commonly used to train agents for a range of applications from robotics to chip design is reinforcement learning (RL). While RL excels at discovering how to solve tasks from scratch, it can struggle in training an agent to understand the reversibility of its actions, which can be crucial to ensure that agents behave in a safe manner within their environment.e. This would indicate an irreversible sequence.4.g.e.g.

                        I was looking into problems people were having with DNS a few months ago and I noticed one common theme – a lot of people have server issues (“my server is down! or it’s slow!“), but they can’t tell if the problem is caused by DNS or not. So here are a few tools I use to tell if a problem I’m having is caused by DNS, as well as a few DNS debuggging stories from my life.

Some of the solutions also use cryptography to make the signatures tamper resistant. Anyone can create their own system for tracking a picture.

                        To say something is efficient is to say that it produces an output with little waste; be that time, resources or energy. What is important to remember is that whoever defines ‘efficiency’ also defines ‘waste’. In software development, the desired output is generally high-quality software. It is easy to think of waste as time not spent directly producing that output, but this may be missing the wood for the trees. Let’s talk about German foresters. James C. James C.

There’s no school that teaches you to be a PM, and most companies have relatively few product managers as a proportion of their total headcount. The pool of vetted and experienced talent is thin. If you want to scale a product team quickly, one of the best ways to move fast is to convert talent from other vocations. One of my favorite sources for SaaS product managers is your own post-sales team – particularly recruiting PMs from customer success.

                        A long time ago, I realized that some of my easiest conversations were while walking or hiking or driving in a car with someone. Then I noticed that group chats were much easier when the group was playing a game. People can go from anxious small talk to conversing like old friends after 5 minutes of poker. For a long time I thought that the key element to this increased ease came from having an activity to do or a shared interest to discuss. People bond over shared interests.

                        Kubernetes is an open source system for managing container-based applications – and if you’re reading this article, you probably already know that containers represent the most popular approach to cloud application architecture. But let’s assume that’s all you know, and take a moment to walk through what containers are, what Kubernetes is and from there, cover off Kubernetes clusters. In the early days of cloud architecture, running in the cloud meant running on virtual machines.

As a result, most practitioners are now familiar with the concept of GitOps, if not the practical details.e.

The vulnerability disclosure was coordinated with multiple organizations, some of whom are now releasing updates to address the security weakness.

I took notes and screen-snapshots during the presentation of this paper, and decided to put together a summary of what I understood from it. The paper has a simple idea and a somewhat unexpected result. It will be interesting to dive deep and explore to the extent this idea can be applied in practice.  Here is the idea. State-machine replication through Paxos , more accurately MultiPaxos, is commonly used in practice.) The MultiPaxos leader drives the protocol.

These are my notes from Mahesh&#39;s excellent conference presentation. These control plane databases at Facebook were required to support multiple APIs: some SQL, some key-value pairs, and some ZooKeeper namespaces. Each such API typically requires a separate database to be built. ( There is plenty of room at the bottom. I agree fully.

                        Hypergeometric functions are defined in terms of their power series representation. This power series converges inside the unit circle and diverges outside. The functions extend to most [1] of the complex plane, and do so in a computationally nice way. Analytic continuation is often sort of existential: we prove that it can be done, but […] The post Escaping the unit disk first appeared on John D. Cook .

                        The ratio test for the convergence of a series is inconclusive if the ratio of consecutive terms converges to 1.

                        We’re excited to announce the general availability of a new feature in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): image streaming. This revolutionary GKE feature has the potential to drastically improve your application scale-up time, allowing you to respond to increased user demand more rapidly, and save money by provisioning less spare capacity. For example, your application may spend a bunch of time connecting to external databases, which barely requires any data from the container image.

                        Healthcare is a complex and technologically rich industry, full of innovations: in therapeutics, in devices, in processes of care and now in software. The key questions healthcare leaders face is whether these innovations are safe, whether they work and whether they add value. The established approaches to answering these questions (clinical trials or long term real world studies) are costly and difficult to scale.   2. Additionally, healthcare is broader than just medicine.  2.  3.   2. 3.

                        As the acute phase of the pandemic has begun to shift towards recovery, local governments have shifted their strategies as well—specifically towards ensuring that billions of dollars of direct aid and services are reaching the people who need them the most. This includes helping with housing for families in need, getting local utilities funding to keep their services operational, and seeing that local landlords have enough money to keep their properties operational.

                        Governments across the globe want to make life easier for their citizens—they want to enable businesses to thrive, increase public safety, and tackle society&#39;s most pressing challenges. Modernizing legacy public sector IT infrastructure is foundational to achieving this, and the right security is a prerequisite for digital transformation.  With so much at stake, governments often take direct ownership of defining security requirements and programs to ensure their data is protected in the cloud.

                        In the public sector, developing new technology requires careful planning—from budgeting, to procurement, to anticipating future software and hardware resources. But even with the best foresight, migrations can be difficult to manage without prior experience working with cloud environments. However, lacking the necessary cloud skills, many projects never get off the ground. Teams no longer need to sacrifice simplicity and ease of use for access to the latest, most powerful technologies.S.

                        In order to keep businesses running, organizations require uninterrupted access to business critical applications. While most of these applications can be accessed through a modern browser, others require a specific legacy browser, which can add extra work for IT teams to try and protect users in older, less secure browsers. Many enterprises use Chrome’s Legacy Browser Support , allowing IT to designate which apps require a legacy browser. Just make sure that it is on version 6.0.0 or later.

So what happens, when you want to move to a managed service in the Cloud, like Cloud SQL , and you discover that your favorite extension isn’t supported? Of course we want to support all the things, but supporting each individual plugin takes time to be sure it gets integrated into Cloud SQL without destabilizing anything.
