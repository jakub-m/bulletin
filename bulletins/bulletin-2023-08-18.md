Introduction In the first post of this series, I discussed the binary search API from the slices package that is now part of the standard library with the release of version 1.21. In this post, I will share how the Clip, Clone, and Compact APIs work. Clip The Clip API can be used to remove unused capacity from a slice. This means reducing the capacity of the slice to match its length.

The 8086 has some quirky characteristics: it is little-endian, has a parity flag, and uses explicit I/O instructions instead of just memory-mapped I/O. It has four 16-bit registers that can be split into 8-bit registers, but only one that can be used for memory indexing.50.30).). table.dp td.

A great many smart people terminably hamper their ability to better understand the world by refusing to accept defeat when reality proves them wrong. Armed with an intellect that&#39;s at once both too proud to recognize it&#39;s own failings and cunningly capable of producing sophisticated excuses, they&#39;re adapt at spotting this failing in others but not in themselves. You see this all the time in the realm of public policy. Someone presents a plausible thesis on how to deal with a given problem.

## [Turing kicked us out of Heaven](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/turing-kicked-us-out-of-heaven/)


The halting problem is &#34;undecidable&#34;: there&#39;s no algorithm which can tell you if an arbitrary program with an arbitrary input will halt or not. IE, if you give me a proposed &#34;halt-detector&#34;, I can inspect it and come up with a program and input for which it would give the wrong answer. Most people think that&#39;s a cool mathematical theory but don&#39;t know the real world relevance, because computers aren&#39;t Turing machines and have finite memory, so all programs are guaranteed to halt.  ↩

What does it take to have a presence that’s felt by those around us? According to Muriel Wilkins, the answer is simple: Be present. “Having presence, at the root of it, [is] your ability to be present,” says Wilkins, a C-suite advisor, executive coach, and host of the HBR podcast, Coaching Real Leaders .

## [Thinking about functional programming](http://notes.eatonphil.com/2023-08-15-thinking-about-functional-programming.html)


Someone on Discord asked about how to learn functional programming. The question and my initial tweet on the subject prompted an interesting discussion with Shriram Krishnamurthi and other folks. So here&#39;s a slightly more thought out exploration. And just for backstory sake: I spent a few years a while ago programming in Standard ML and I wrote a chunk of a Scheme implementation . I&#39;m not an expert, but I have a bit of background. Hey, this is a free opinion. e.g. It&#39;s leetcode with meaning.

I think it’s the latter, and I think it’s the something like the latter forever. This is a good thing. I’m so glad we reached an empirical point of disagreement. Can superintelligent AIs “solve” the one shot prisoners dilemma and play cooperate-cooperate? Yudkowsky thinks yes, I think no.

So far, the silicon technology at the heart of this revolution has been truly prodigious. The processes of assembling silicon wafers and the superimposition of tracks and gates hs been the subject of continual refinement, and some 75 years after the invention of the transistor we are now able to cram almost a trillion of them onto a silicon wafer not much biggeer than a fingernail. Have we reached the end of this silicon road, or is there more to come?

It’s built on top of Netty , using event loops for non-blocking execution of requests, one loop per core. To reduce contention among event loops, we created connection pools for each, keeping them completely independent. There is also a significant downside. In this example, each subset has 0.

## [Forward Compatibility and Toolchain Management in Go 1.21](https://go.dev/blog/toolchain)


The Go Blog Forward Compatibility and Toolchain Management in Go 1.21 Russ Cox 14 August 2023 Beyond Go 1.21’s expanded commitment to backward compatibility , Go 1.21 also introduces better forward compatibility for Go code, meaning that Go 1.21 and later will take better care not to miscompile code that requires an even newer version of Go. Specifically, the go line in go.mod now specifies a minimum required Go toolchain version, while in previous releases it was a mostly unenforced suggestion.

## [Backward Compatibility, Go 1.21, and Go 2](https://go.dev/blog/compat)


The Go Blog Backward Compatibility, Go 1.21, and Go 2 Russ Cox 14 August 2023 Go 1.21 includes new features to improve compatibility. Before you stop reading, I know that sounds boring. But boring can be good. Back in the early days of Go 1, Go was exciting and full of surprises. Each week we cut a new snapshot release and everyone got to roll the dice to see what we’d changed and how their programs would break. Boring is good. Boring is stable.21 to keep Go boring.Stdout.Stdout at all.File .21.

Given a set of r random values from a large set (of size N), I have been using the formula 1-exp(-r**2/(2N)) to approximate the probability of a collision. It assumes that r is much smaller than N. The formula suggests that if you have hundreds of millions of random 64-bit numbers, you will start getting … Continue reading How accurate is the birthday’s paradox formula?

Most strings online are Unicode strings in the UTF-8 format. Other systems (e.g., Java, Microsoft) might prefer UTF-16. However, Latin 1 is still a common encoding (e.g., within JavaScript runtimes). Its relationship with Unicode is simple: Latin 1 includes the first 256 Unicode characters. It is rich enough to convert most of the standard European … Continue reading Transcoding UTF-8 strings to Latin 1 strings at 18 GB/s using AVX-512

This is a short update from Weaveworks about yesterday’s announcement from HashiCorp that they will move many of their open source products—including Terraform and Vault—from the MPL2 license to the Business Source License (BSL, or BUSL) 1.1. MPL2 is open source. BSL 1.1 is not. What does that mean for Weaveworks, and possibly for you? For now we’ll limit our commentary on HashiCorp’s strategy to a few general remarks. HashiCorp can and should act in the best interest of its customers.1.
