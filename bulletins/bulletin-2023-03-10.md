As part of my emulator explorations I went down a curiosity rabbit hole about polymorphic shellcode and learned about something fun I&#39;d like to share with you! The world of exploits is pretty sophisticated and if you&#39;re not into it it can be hard to follow. Shellcode is roughly &#34;the code the attacker wants to inject into the attacked system&#34;. It is typically a small snippet just used as the initial stage of an attack that bootstraps into remote access or downloading more code.g.g.......

An unusual topic for this blog, but worth boosting to a larger audience: Google Groups is dying. Its epitaph is not yet inscribed on the Killed by Google website, but the end is easily seen from here (although it should also be noted its death was called as early as 13 years ago). The deficiencies in Google Groups search, supposedly Google’s forte, have long been noted. Lately though basic features have just stopped working.

The Go Blog Code coverage for Go integration tests Than McIntosh 8 March 2023 Code coverage tools help developers determine what fraction of a source code base is executed (covered) when a given test suite is executed. Go has for some time provided support ( introduced in the Go 1.2 release) to measure code coverage at the package level, using the &#34;-cover&#34; flag of the “go test” command. This tooling works well in most cases, but has some weaknesses for larger Go applications. With Go 1.git .....

Organizations rely on numerous solutions apart from Kubernetes to assist in their cloud-native journey. One prominent tool used to provision and manage resources in the cloud is Terraform. However, there are numerous challenges to managing Terraform that can be addressed by Weave GitOps’ Terraform Controller. What is Weave GitOps Terraform Controller?

In recent times, I&#39;ve been realizing more and more just how much a screwed up management situation can lead to screwed up technical situations. I&#39;ve written a bit about this in the past few months, and got to thinking about a specific anecdote from not too long ago. I was working on a team which was supposed to be the &#34;last line of defense&#34; for outages and other badness like that. We couldn&#39;t figure out why it kept happening. What I found was interesting. This pretty much worked.

Words have impact. But when it comes to enchanting audiences and captivating with communication, Jonah Berger , PhD ’07, says some words are more potent than others. Berger is a Wharton School professor and an internationally bestselling author. His most recent book, Magic Words: What to Say to Get Your Way , identifies language we can use to communicate more effectively in all sorts of personal and professional contexts. Magic words allow us to change minds, engage audiences, and drive action.

At some point in your career you will be asked to manage a project. This can be intimidating, it can be scary, but it doesn’t have to be. We can leverage some time-honoured techniques, and adapt them to the unique approach required for software projects to deliver on time, on budget, and with success. This article is a collection of techniques I’ve learned for managing projects over time, that attempts to combine agile best practices with project management best practices.

If you prefer, Microsoft makes available ClangCL which couples the LLVM compiler (commonly used by Apple) with the Visual Studio backend.

## [Automating the Cloud — hiding the complexity of hardware provisioning](https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/03/provisioning-cloud-infrastructure.html)


Hardware is always hard. The amount of operations, maintenance and planning that goes into supporting a data center is a daunting challenge for any enterprise. Though often unseen, without hardware there is no software. Although software seems to be a well defined domain with stable tools, practices and languages, hardware has had no such luck. That is why the complexities are often hidden. That is also what Cloud computing promises. Thus, every component can be set up as a piece of code.utils.

This paper is from VLDB2020. Aria is an OLTP database that does epoch-based commits similar to the Silo paper we discussed last week. Unlike Silo, which was a single-node database, Aria is a distributed and deterministic database. Aria&#39;s biggest contribution is that it improves on Calvin by being able to run transactions without prior knowledge of read and write sets. Aria versus Calvin Recall that Calvin uses locks ( here is a summary of the Calvin paper ). This works as follows.) Rule 1.e.15.

The first part is an iOS app that works like a video camera app, but also scans the room and records the device’s orientation (and more!) alongside each video recording. The second part is a Blender plugin that imports these recordings and recreates the device’s experience within Blender as faithfully as possible.

You can&#39;t convince someone invested in their convictions to the contrary by arguments alone. Only actions can pry open a locked mind, and most minds remain locked most of the time. So if you wish to be persuasive, you ought to spend less time arguing and more time doing. This is as it should be. Talk is cheap, and others are right to keep their considered positions from being for sale at a discount. This is why we listen more to those who do than those who merely opine.

## [Some possible reasons for 8-bit bytes](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/03/06/possible-reasons-8-bit-bytes/)


 So we’re going to talk about some computer history. As an example of a historical accident: DNS has a class field which has 5 possible values (“internet”, “chaos”, “hesiod”, “none”, and “any”). To me that’s a clear example of a historical accident – I can’t imagine that we’d define the class field the same way if we could redesign DNS today without worrying about backwards compatibility. I think the answer is some combination of these reasons. The word size is some multiple of the byte size.2.

Hello! For some reason after the last nix post I got nerdsniped by trying to understand how Nix builds work under the hood, so here’s a quick exploration I did today. There are probably some mistakes in here. I wanted to take this a tiny bit further and compile a slightly more complicated C program. the goal: compile a C program, without using Nix’s standard machinery Our goal is to compile a C program called paperjam . This is a real C program that wasn’t in the Nix repository already.1.sh ).2.

Then they ask me how to learn it and I falter. I estimated it would be in early-access by June 2021. These all affect the design decisions of the book. The whole section is about 5,000 words..

Miki chose this method because the variable returned by said function implements the io.Reader interface which is crucial for the next step. The remaining parts of this function consisted of a primitive type alias that satisfied the io.

One notable feature of Bazel is the ability to use a cache. A cache speeds up the build process and reduces build times, especially for large projects with many dependencies. A Bazel cache can either be local or remote (shared) . A local cache is stored on the same computer where Bazel is running.bazelrc file.
