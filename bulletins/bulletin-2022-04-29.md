On Thursday, November 18, 2021, Dropbox did not go down. On a normal day this would be a non-event—a sign that everything was operating as usual. However, this day was anything but usual. At 5:00 pm PT, a group of Dropboxers were huddled on a Zoom call when the command was given to physically unplug our San Jose data center from the rest of the Dropbox network. A core Dropbox value is being worthy of our customer’s trust. This is the story of how we did it. This process is called a failover.).).

Here’s the cover and table of contents: why DNS? I wanted to write about DNS for three reasons: DNS is everywhere!

This is a closely related paper to the &#34;Evaluation of Distributed Concurrency Control&#34; paper we just covered . This paper is also from VDLB&#39;17, and also has Andy Pavlo as an author . This time we zoom-in on the multiversion concurrency control protocols, and investigate their performances on a single node database management system (DBMS) with in-memory multicore execution.  In a single-version system transactions always overwrite a tuple with new information whenever they update it.

## [Tailscale Authentication for NGINX](https://tailscale.com/blog/tailscale-auth-nginx/)


Previously on the Tailscale blog, I walked through how authentication works with Tailscale for Grafana and even for Minecraft . Today we’re going to take that basic concept and show how to extend it to services that you have proxied behind NGINX . The Grafana/Minecraft authentication proxy trick works because we set up a whole new node on your tailnet to proxy traffic directly to Grafana or Minecraft. This does work, but there’s a nonzero setup cost every time you add a new service to the mix.

## [Android TV remote control](https://tailscale.com/blog/android-tv/)


In this guest post, Elias Naur walks us through running Tailscale on Android TV. Running Tailscale on an Android TV device is useful for the situations where you’re trying to connect to a big screen, but can’t use a desktop or mobile device. For example, you might want to access your home media server to watch your favorite TV shows when you’re on the go in a hotel room or Airbnb, and only have an Android TV stick to connect to the provided TV. The immediate mode design simplifies UI logic.

Every push also builds the virtualenv as the artifact, so if you want to see the current state of the documentation, you can clone the repo, download the venv, and then run venv/bin/sphinx-build to get a local copy. Currently I’m 15,000 words in and expect to have the first public version ready by the end of June. ..  ↩

One of the core features of modern Java is lambda expressions. Introduced in Java 8, lambdas provide concise syntax allowing the deferred execution of a block of code. Put a different way, lambdas allow us to pass behaviour as a method parameter. When the method executes, the lambda expression is run. This capability is often referred to as behaviour parameterization.

Digg’s tech platform and data didn’t survive its acquisition .

One of my favorite parts of senior leadership roles is that you periodically get to deep dive on something that you typically don’t focus on too closely. At Stripe, I got to serve as the interim leader of the Payments Infrastructure organization for a few months, which gave me the chance to support a couple hundred additional folks working in an adjacent area of the company, while also continuing to support the Foundation organization I worked with throughout my time there.

This ensures that a codebase does not get updated with changes that could break something. Continuous delivery (CD), on the other hand, builds upon CI by automating releases of these branches or the main branch.py file.circleci folder.
