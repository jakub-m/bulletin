Two phase locking (2PL) was the first of the general-purpose Concurrency Controls to be invented which provided Serializability. In fact, 2PL gives more than Serializability, it gives Opacity, a much stronger isolation level. 2PL was published in 1976, which incidentally is the year I was born, and it is likely that Jim Gray and his buddies had this idea long before it was published, which means 2PL first came to existence nearly 50 years ago .

I heard something during the trucker protest in Canada along the lines of: “Most people here don’t want to live in a free society. A free society requires personal responsiblity. People here want to be managed. They want a ruling class.” I heard something similar once from a journalist in Egypt who shared a taxi with a man smoking hashish. I’ve asked friends for feedback on wireheading city , and across the political spectrum there seems to be support for the idea. You have very limited freedom.

You said it. But did they hear it? For Frances Frei, communication is about saying things simply enough for an audience to truly understand. As a professor of technology and operations management at Harvard Business School, Frei knows that shaping culture within organizations requires communicating in ways that influence how people think and act. The problem for many leaders, she says, is that when we “understand something deeply, we describe it in a complicated way.

A key concept for a processor is the management of &#34;state&#34;, information that persists over time. Much of a computer is built from logic gates, such as NAND or NOR gates, but logic gates have no notion of time. Processors also need a way to hold values, along with a mechanism to move from step to step in a controlled fashion. This is the role of &#34;sequential logic&#34;, where the output depends on what happened before. (If you have a 3.2 GHz processor, for instance, that number is the clock frequency.

&#34;Ordinary Wolves&#34; by Seth Kantner - a fictional account about coming of age as a subsistence hunter and fur trader in remote Alaska wilderness in the 1970s and 80s. Since I&#39;ve read &#34;A thousand trails home&#34; already, the plot is very familiar - the author projected a lot of his own autobiography here. Overall the book is good, but the language is too convoluted and artsy in my opinion - plain writing would have made the book much better. Of the whole series, I liked this book the least, by far...

## [Seniority and self-management: you don&#39;t have to do this alone](https://jacobian.org/2023/oct/4/seniority-and-self-management/)


At a certain level of seniority – typically the Staff level for ICs, and the Director level for managers – you’ll be expected to fully own huge areas of responsibility without detailed guidance. The mistake that many people make when they’re new to this level of autonomy is believing they have to do it all themselves. At this level of seniority, you have to recognize your weaknesses, figure out what kind of support you need, and take steps to get yourself that support.

This paper is from VLDB 2020. TiDB is an opensource Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) database, developed by PingCap. The TiDB server, written in Go, is the query/transaction processing component; it is stateless, in the sense that  it does not store data and it is for computing only. The underlying key-value store, TiKV, is written in Rust, and it uses RocksDB as the storage engine. They add a columnar store called TiFlash, which gets most of the coverage in this paper.e.e.

The most popular SQLite and PostgreSQL database drivers in Go are (roughly) 20-76% slower than alternatives on insert-heavy benchmarks of mine. So if you are bulk-inserting data with Go (and potentially also bulk-retrieving data with Go), you may want to consider the driver carefully. And you may want to consider avoiding database/sql . Other driver authors have noted and benchmarked issues with database/sql . So it may be the case that database/sql is responsible for some of this overhead.

How software fails is interesting. But real-world errors can be infrequent to manifest.

Jepsen and ChaosMonkey are two famous examples that help to trigger process and network failure. But LD_PRELOAD layer only works if IO goes through libc, which won&#39;t be the case for all programs. $ cat test / main . OpenFile ( &#34;test.txt&#34; , os .

## [I’m not a programmer, and I used AI to build my first bot](https://blog.replit.com/building-my-first-slack-bot)


Before I joined Replit, I had never written a line of code. Last week, I built a Slack Bot that uses Google LLMs to provide daily channel summaries. None of this was possible without Replit. Let me explain why: 1. Getting started with no setup 2. Using Replit AI capabilities 3. Learning LLMs with ModelFarm 4. Simple hosting and deployments GETTING STARTED WITH NO SETUP I studied Finance, Marketing, and Math. I never took a single Computer Science class. Every time, I would get stuck early on.

## [Sep 29 Incident Update: Read-Only Repls](https://blog.replit.com/sep-29-read-only-repls)


On Sep 29, we had a period of about 2.5h from 14:00 to 16:30 (Pacific Time), in which an incomplete build was pushed to our infrastructure that handles storing Repl data. This caused Repls opened during that time window to become read-only or stop working. Any Repl not opened during that timeframe was not affected. We have addressed the root cause, recovered 98% of the affected Repls, and continue to work on recovering the remaining 2%. This enables fast and efficient Repl forking.replit.replit.

If you’ve worked with projects hosted on GitHub, you’re probably aware of GitHub Actions . GitHub Actions is GitHub’s recommended way of setting up build automation and workflows from your GitHub-hosted repo. It supports multiple triggers and operations, including uploading and downloading artifacts. Artifacts represent the final or intermediate products of these build pipelines. In a build pipeline, the artifacts typically consist of executable binaries created at its end.github/workflows/node.
