Pretty much every company I know is looking for a way to benefit from Large Language Models. Even if their executives don’t see much applicability, their investors likely do, so they’re staring at the blank page nervously trying to come up with an idea. It’s straightforward to make an argument for LLMs improving internal efficiency somehow, but it’s much harder to describe a believable way that LLMs will make your product more useful to your customers.g.g.g.g.g.g.g.g.g.

It’s no secret I am a big fan of the “power of two random choices” algorithm (or more generally best-of-k) for resource based load balancing. I have written several articles about it (such as this one ) on why it’s so damn powerful and various ways to improve it further. Today, I want to discuss a very interesting trick you can pull in a high traffic situation to greatly reduce number of samples and improve placement quality using micro-batching. One such example is with GPU inferencing .

Study reports of productivity in remote work are all over the internet. According to The New York Times , some studies link remote work with productivity declines of 8–14%. Others show remote work increases productivity by 13% to 24%. You’re probably thinking, what affects remote work productivity levels? The answer is a combination of many aspects that begin at the workplace. For example, when you work in an environment with poor lighting, you’ll experience headaches and eyestrain. Read on.

This paper appeared in OSDI&#39;23. I haven&#39;t read the paper, and I am going by the two presentations I have seen of the paper, and by a quick skim of the paper. The paper has a cool idea, and I decided I should not procrastinate more waiting to read the paper in detail, and instead just capture and communicate this idea. Datacenter networking got very fast, much faster than SSD/disk I/O. That means, rather than two-phase commit (2PC), cold reads from SSD/disk is the dominant latency.

Introduction In my previous post, I discussed the current state of looping in Go. In this post, we’re going to look into a future feature for the Go programming language called range-over function experiment. Go lacks a standard iterator protocol and this is an attempt to provide one. We’ll discuss the motivation for adding this new feature and see some examples on how to use it. NOTE: In order to run the code, you need to set the GOEXPERIMENT environment variable to rangefunc (e.

In early 2024, I hit ten years at Allegro , which also happens to be how long I’ve been working with microservices . This timespan also roughly corresponds to how long the company as a whole has been using them, so I think it’s a good time to outline the story of project Rubicon: a very ambitious gamble which completely changed how we work and what our software is like. It was founded in 1999, originally with just the Polish market in mind. Tests were brittle and took ages to finish.

## [Advanced port configuration](https://blog.replit.com/ports)


We recently spent a few months making ports easier to work with on Replit, so you can develop more complex apps predictably. What are ports? When a computer receives a TCP/UDP request, ports define which program that request should route to. (If you need a more basic explanation of TCP ports, start here). You can think of ports like mailboxes.

Scaling up a startup – rapidly growing from say $2M to $200M ARR – is an exciting and challenging journey. You aren’t quite a startup anymore, but you’re also definitely not a big company. And given the high rate of growth, the nature of the job changes meaningfully over the course of just a few years. Few companies get to this point, and the time period is relatively brief: the strongest companies go from ~$1-2M ARR to $200M&#43; in well under ten years. They have a wide range of competence.

The worst kind of company is usually not the one where there&#39;s too much real work to do, but the kind where there&#39;s not enough. It&#39;s in this realm the real monsters appear. Without enough real problems to go around, humans are prone to invent fictitious and dreadful ones. This is the root of David Graeber&#39;s Bullshit Jobs analysis. It&#39;s enough to make anyone mad. Now part of the problem is clearly one of perspective. But it&#39;s not all subjective either. Made-up problems are a blight.

I&#39;ve always hated the saying &#34;we&#39;re like family here&#34; when it comes to work. Because it&#39;s obviously not true, and it&#39;s usually cynically invoked by management to entice an undue obligation of sacrifice. Implying that you should give it all to The Company -- constantly working weekends, always being available on vacations, and all the rest -- but when the necessities of the business change, you&#39;ll realize the obligation was never truly mutual. So far, so agreeable to most people.

Question: Hey Vadim, So, I&#39;ve been coding for money for about 5 years now. I&#39;ve jumped around a lot — Java, Javascript, Python, NodeJS — you name it. The job market&#39;s been great, making it super easy for me to switch between gigs. I&#39;ve done both full-time and contract work across many different companies. I think I&#39;ve reached the level of being senior as I take on more and more responsibility. At every place I&#39;ve been at, they seemed to love me. But, personally, I&#39;ve always felt a bit off.

Been reading online that lots of devs are struggling to find steady gigs. Is your company looking for any devs? What&#39;s your take on this? All my buddies are in the same boat, fighting to land jobs but everywhere demands at least 1-2 years of experience. I want to move out and get away from my family.

Question: Hey Vadim, Here&#39;s the situation: from the moment my alarm clock interrupts my sleep, until I finally come home late at night, my life is essentially a never-ending cycle of sitting in front of the PC and stressing with a workload that feels like it&#39;s set to max. I feel like I&#39;m playing Dark Souls around the clock. I&#39;m doing solid 60&#43; hours EVERY week, running on a treadmill that&#39;s just a bit too fast — no matter how hard I hustle, I can&#39;t get to the finish line.

The idea of powering civilization from gigantic solar plants in orbit is older than any space program , but despite seven decades of rocket science, the concept—to gather near-constant sunlight tens of thousands of kilometers above the equator, beam it to Earth as microwaves, and convert it to electricity—still remains tantalizingly over the horizon. And yet the dream lives on. The dream achieved a kind of lift-off in January 2023. SSPD-1 flew with several different testbeds. Hajimiri: Yes.
