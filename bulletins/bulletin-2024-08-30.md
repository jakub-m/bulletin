## [Game of Life](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1041-Game-of-Life.html)


There are things we do because they are fun, and things we do because we have to. If I have to do something boring, then I might as well try to make it fun. Like vacuuming the floor. I&#39;m not much of a dancer, but give me a vacuum cleaner and I&#39;ll dance across the entire house. When a Spammer Calls If I&#39;m sitting at my desk and the phone rings, I will answer it. More often than not, it&#39;s a spammer. However, rather than hanging up on them, I turn it into a game and try to achieve certain goals...

Time is state Imagine I put an ordinary ticking quartz clock in an empty room. I walk in, and ten minutes later I walk out with two photograph prints. 1 In the 1st one, the second hand is pointing at the top of the clock, in the 2nd it&#39;s pointing at the bottom. Are these two copies of the same photo, or are they two different pictures? There&#39;s no trick here, the answer is &#34;different photos&#34;. Since the clock looks different, time must have passed between the two. The update to x advanced time.  ↩

Most programming languages support floating-point numbers. You typically have the ability to turn a string into a floating-point number. E.g., “3.1416” could be parsed as a number close to pi. However strings typically cannot be represented exactly or at all. For example, “1e-1000” is too small and “1e1000” is too large for even 64-bit floating-point … Continue reading Parsing tiny and very large floating-point values: a programming-language comparison

Earlier this year I wrote a post about implementing BPE tokenization in Go , which made it possible to reproduce OpenAI&#39;s tokenizer. Today I want to mention a new project I&#39;ve been hacking on recently: go-sentencepiece - a pure Go implementation of the SentencePiece tokenizer that&#39;s used for Google AI&#39;s models like Gemma and Gemini. SentencePiece has a canonical C&#43;&#43; implementation and Python bindings (using SWIG). This is what go-sentencepiece is for. There are two parts to this: first is a .pb.

I recently played through Halo: The Master Chief Collection in chronological-ish order. This was mostly straightforward, with one wrinkle: when should I play Halo 3: ODST? ODST’s story begins right at the end of Halo 2’s fifth level, “Metropolis” . The game makes heavy use of flashbacks and some missions take place concurrently with Halo 2’s, making it tricky to know when to play certain levels. If I did it again, I’d probably skip ODST entirely. Other than that, I’m happy with my playthrough.

Even if you believe that strategy is generally useful, it is difficult to decide that today’s the day to start writing engineering strategy. When you do start writing strategy, it’s easy write so much strategy that your organization is overwhelmed and ignores your strategy rather than investing time into understanding it. Fortunately, these are universal problems, and there are a handful of useful mental models to avoid both extremes. Often writing nothing is the best available choice.g.g.g.

## [Children of You](https://world.hey.com/dhh/children-of-you-a2f93dfa)


The birth rate is dropping all over the world. In some places, like South Korea (0.72), it is so low people are starting to worry about a national extinction . In other places, including all of Europe (average 1.5, Spain 1.29), it&#39;s merely bad and alarming. And nobody seems to know exactly why.  Even in Denmark, it&#39;s now so low (1.5) that the government went from estimating a lack of 5,000 child care professionals to suddenly looking at a 2,000 person surplus by 2035 . At 1.1.

It&#39;s hard to sell simple, because simple looks easy, and who wants to pay for that? Of course, everyone says they want something simple, but the way they buy reveals that they usually don&#39;t. This is the secret that the merchants of complexity have long since figured out. That clever and sophisticated beats basic and straightforward most days in the market. Since both clever and sophisticated implies something special, and only what&#39;s special command the premium dollar. To feel special.

## [DDIA: Chp 4. Encoding and Evolution (Part 1)](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/08/ddia-chp-4-encoding-and-evolution-part-1.html)


This first part of Chapter 4 of the Designing Data Intensive Applications (DDIA) book discusses the concepts of data encoding and evolution in data-intensive applications. As applications inevitably change over time, it&#39;s important to build systems that can adapt to these changes easily, a property referred to as evolvability (under maintainability) in Chapter 1 of the book . Different data models handle change differently. Let&#39;s get started., optimized for CPU access and manipulation. 2.

As part of our zoom reading group ( wow, 4.5 years old now ), we discussed a paper that uses LLMs for automatic root cause analysis (RCA) for cloud incidents. This was a pretty straightforward application of LLMs. The proposed system employs an LLM to match incoming incidents to incident handlers based on their alert types, predicts the incident&#39;s root cause category, and provides an explanatory narrative. The only customization is through prompt-engineering. Let me explain.

For too long, businesses seemed to avoid making sustainable changes because they were under the impression that doing so was too costly. Yet, in recent years, it’s become clearer that sustainability isn’t just an important ethical consideration, but it can also influence business success. Indeed, a sustainable business tends to be a more productive business . The wonderful Katie Brenneman writes this week’s article. Thank you, Katie, for writing this for me. Addressing Climate Risks.

With everything flying towards us each day, we can be forgiven for dropping tasks we know are important, but are not screaming at us to be completed. Tasks such as checking in with a customer or spending some time with our partner to see if they are okay. The problem here is not the occasional dropping of these types of tasks; we stop doing them altogether. We never seem to have time to do them. There&#39;s always an excuse. It&#39;s a non-negotiable part of my day.

Multiple media reports this week warned Americans to be on guard against a new phishing scam that arrives in a text message informing recipients they are not yet registered to vote. A bit of digging reveals the missives were sent by a California political consulting firm as part of a well-meaning but potentially counterproductive get-out-the-vote effort that had all the hallmarks of a phishing campaign.

One of the biggest challenges observability teams face today is gaining end-to-end visibility into their cloud native apps, including modern browser frontends. Without that visibility, you potentially open the door to bad end-user experiences that can hurt customer satisfaction, reduce search engine discoverability, and interfere with overall business goals. This is the exact challenge we address with Grafana Cloud Frontend Observability . Let’s walk through an example. There’s our root cause.

Over the last few years, I’ve added a fair amount of smart-home technology to my house. Among other things, I can control lights and outlets, monitor the status of various appliances, measure how much electricity and water I’m using, and even cut off the water supply in the event of a leak. All this technology is coordinated through a hub, which I originally accessed through a conventional browser-based interface. The heart of my Home Assistant setup is a hub powered by an old PC running Linux.

## [Robot Metalsmiths Are Resurrecting Toroidal Tanks for NASA](https://spectrum.ieee.org/metal-forming-robot)


In the 1960s and 1970s, NASA spent a lot of time thinking about whether toroidal (donut-shaped) fuel tanks were the way to go with its spacecraft. Toroidal tanks have a bunch of potential advantages over conventional spherical fuel tanks. For example, you can fit nearly 40% more volume within a toroidal tank than if you were using multiple spherical tanks within the same space. Because of their relatively complex shape, toroidal tanks are much more difficult to make than spherical tanks.

Thirty-five years ago, a misguided AIDS activist developed a piece of malware that encrypted a computer’s filenames—and asked for US $189 to obtain the key that unlocked an afflicted system. This “AIDS Trojan” holds the dubious distinction of being the world’s first piece of ransomware . In the intervening decades the encryption behind ransomware has become more sophisticated and harder to crack, and the underlying criminal enterprise has only blossomed like a terrible weed.C.S...S.
