In this article, we want to share our approach to using server-driven UI in native mobile apps. In 2019 we created the first version of the in-house server-driven rendering tool called MBox and used it to render the homepage in the Allegro app on Android and iOS . We have come a long way since then, and now we use this tool to render more and more screens in the Allegro app. Why server-driven UI? The idea behind MBox was to make mobile development faster without compromising the app quality.).

## [Strict-serializability, but at what cost, for what purpose?](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/08/strict-serializability-but-at-what-cost.html)


Strict-serializability guarantees that transactions appear to occur in an order consistent with the &#34;real-time&#34; ordering of those transactions: If transaction T1 commits before transaction T2 is invoked, then the commit timestamp of T1 precedes the commit timestamp of T2. This is, in fact, the real-time constraint from linearizability , but applied across transactions not just per-key. Below figure is from https://jepsen.io/consistency . Linearizability alone can be cheap, because it is per key.

This paper (which will appear at VLDB&#39;2022) studies the production workloads of Facebook&#39;s social graph datastore TAO, and distills them to a small set of representative features.  The integrity of TAOBench&#39;s workloads are validated by testing them against their production counterparts.

Managing privileged access can help improve security by reducing unnecessary access to sensitive resources and customer data. With Tailscale ACLs , you can already manage access to company resources and restrict access with “default deny” rules . But what if there’s an emergency, and the person on call needs to access your production environment? Solving this is why we’re excited to partner with Sym ! Now, users can easily request temporary access to sensitive resources in Tailscale via Slack.

## [Can High Quality Software Be Useless?](https://tomgamon.com/posts/can-high-quality-software-be-useless/)


I have been thinking quite a lot about software quality recently. We are in the midst of delivering a project that has some deadline pressure, making me wonder about whether I should trade off certain aspects of quality to get to market quicker. The classic dilemma. I think there is a danger however, when thinking about software quality, to just think of the code itself: nicely abstracted, easy to change, well tested. Value to customers must make up part of our quality assessment.

## [TIL: Developers are a bit Creepy](https://tomgamon.com/posts/til-developers-are-creepy/)


I read a really interesting paper recently entitled “On the Nature of Creepiness” which was a bit of a study into what makes people ‘creepy’. As part of gathering some data, they surveyed a number of people to get their idea of what a ‘creepy’ profession is. Clowns and taxidermists are right up there but software engineers came out with an average score of around 2 (on a scale of 1-5) - not creepy but not not-creepy. Less creepy than a writer but more creepy than a meteorologist.

After six years of service we are sad to announce that Weave Cloud will be shut down on the 30th September 2022. All subscribers will receive three months of free service (July 1st, 2022 - September 30th, 2022) to thank you for using the platform over its lifetime. If you have questions or need help please contact the support team who will be happy to help. While containers bring many benefits, the distributed architecture and overall management can be very complex.

## [A Pocket Guide to Progressive Delivery with GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/pocket-guide-progressive-delivery)


James Governor of Redmonk first introduced the term progressive delivery - a model that includes practices like feature flagging, canary launches, A/B testing, blue-green deployments, and so on. It was met with a lot of excitement as it brought greater control over deployments without compromising on speed. Progressive delivery, however, includes implementation, management, and monitoring of the releases. Taking care of all these critical tasks manually is tedious to say the least.

GitOps is becoming an indispensable part of today’s workflows. CI/CD pipelines are incomplete without the proper GitOps implementation if you want your deliveries to be secure. Today, organizations are expected to deliver new releases and features quicker than ever. However, sometimes speed takes precedence over quality, and bad code can make its way to production, incurring high costs to the organization. You can find plenty of support for GitOps implementation in cloud-native workloads.

When creating an application, developers often rely on many different tools, programs, and people. This collection of agents and actors involved in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is called the software supply chain . The software supply chain refers to anything that touches or influences applications during development, production, and deployment — including developers, dependencies, network interfaces, and DevOps practices. Most often, the SDLC uses dependencies for optimal function.

## [Bass: the beat drop after Concourse (Ship It! #64)](https://changelog.com/shipit/64)


Our today’s guest spent 4 days building a feature for his side project so that we could ship it together on Ship It!, while recording. The feature is called rave mode, and the context is Bass, an interpreted functional scripting language written in Go, riffing on the ideas of Kernel &amp; Clojure. When the local build runs, you can now press r to synchronise the beats of your currently playing Spotify track with the build output. For a demo, see bass v0.9.0 release. Please welcome Alex Suraci, a.k.
