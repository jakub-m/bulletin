Do you ever need to debug a node on kubernetes? Maybe the networking is broken, or you need to check something else out? The netshoot docker container contains a large number of helpful network tools like tcpdump, iperf, and more. Use a script like this to kubectl directly to a node with escalated privileges. Once in, try tcpdump -i any to see all network traffic on the node.

## [Introducing Earthly Functions: Reusable Code for More Modular, Consistent Build Files](https://earthly.dev/blog/earthly-functions/)


The concept of functions runs deep in software development. Pretty much every programming language has functions or something similar that delivers the same capabilities: a block of code that performs a specific task that you can call from anywhere. Functions are a fundamental part of C. Methods, functions associated with specific classes, are part of almost every object-oriented programming language. Even SQL has functions. They make it easier to make programs modular and code reusable.0.7.

## [The Jitter Bug Part 2](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1029-The-Jitter-Bug-Part-2.html)


Last February, I wrote about a really bad bug that was randomly crashing my CPUs. With a virtual machine (VM) environment, if one CPU crashes then the VM can continue running while crippled. When the last CPU crashes, the VM is dead and needs to be restarted. This had been going on for nearly a year. I ended up building a huge monitoring infrastructure that could notify me when a problem developed. While it tried to catch the root cause, it only got close enough to narrow down the cause.4.4.4.4.

In today’s digital age, the sheer volume of information we encounter can be overwhelming. Whether it’s meeting notes, personal projects or creative endeavours, managing digital notes has become valuable for productivity and effectiveness. Yet, the challenge lies not in doing the work itself but in organising our notes effectively so they are useful to us and reduce the time it takes to find the information we need when we need it. Yet, to do so, you need to see your notes randomly.99.

Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence! — Edgar Dijkstra, Notes on Structured Programming Dijkstra was famous for his spicy quips; he&#39;d feel right at home on tech social media. He said things he knows aren&#39;t absolutely true but will get people listening to him. Even if a function has infinite inputs, tests prove the absence of bugs for tested inputs . 1 You can use testing to complete a proof. f(x) . There are two possible takeaways..

The head of counterintelligence for a division of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) was sentenced last week to nine years in a penal colony for accepting a USD $1.7 million bribe to ignore the activities of a prolific Russian cybercrime group that hacked thousands of e-commerce websites. The protection scheme was exposed in 2022 when Russian authorities arrested six members of the group, which sold millions of stolen payment cards at flashy online shops like Trump&#39;s Dumps.

Whether you&#39;re looking to boost your productivity, find more joy in your work, or simply be more present in the moment, you need flow — and research by Assistant Professor David Melnikoff could help you find it. Melnikoff investigates how we pursue our goals, and how flow — the state of being totally immersed and engaged in what we’re doing — can help us achieve them. With each action that we take, the path before us narrows, leading us more directly to the goal that we’ve set.

## [Linux OSSNA&#39;24](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/04/linux-ossna24.html)


Last week I attended the Linux Foundation Open Software Summit North America (OSSNA). The TLA&#43; Conference (which I wrote about here) was colocated with Linux OSSNA as a pre-conference event, and having made the continental cross, it made sense to stay for the first two days of OSSNA. Linus Torvalds would speak on day 2, and there were several sessions about different aspects of Linux  ecosystem. The embedded opensource summit was also colocated with this event as well.5 million square feet...

## [TLA&#43; conference 2024](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/04/tla-conference-2024.html)


The TLA&#43; foundation got established last year in April as an independent, non-profit organization under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation. This April 15th, we colocated our annual TLA&#43; conference with the Linux OSSNA event to reach out to developers attending this event. Being under Linux Foundation, we didn&#39;t have to pay for the venue, but we paid $3K for professional recording of the sessions, so we can share the talks with the world at large. Brooker is a VP/distinguished engineer at AWS.

Go back to the roots: experience. An expert is someone who has repeatedly solved the concrete problem you are encountering. If your toilet leaks, an experienced plumber is an expert. An expert has a track record and has had to face the consequences of their work. Failing is part of what makes an expert: any … Continue reading How do you recognize an expert?

If I’ll ever stop programming it will be because I can no longer find the energy to parse even just one more string format.

The Babylon Bee ran this amazing bit last year: &#34;Study Finds 100% Of Men Would Immediately Leave Their Desk Job If Asked To Embark Upon A Trans-Antarctic Expedition On A Big Wooden Ship&#34;. Yes. Exactly. Modern office workers are often starved for ambition, adventure, and even discomfort. This is why there&#39;s an endless line of recruits willing to sign up to work for leaders like Musk, despite his reputation for being an erratic hard ass. The ambition is worth it. Because real ambition is rare.

This was back in the 1990s, the era of &#34;cutting off the air supply&#34; , of embrace-extend-extinguish , of open source as a &#34;cancer&#34; , and of Bill Gates before he sought reputational refugee in philanthropy. What made the animosity so strong was the sense of being trapped. That the alternatives to the Wintel monopoly of the time was so inferior as to essentially require giving up on modern computing. Saved, even. Open source most of all..

Google&#39;s announcement that they&#39;re done discussing politics at work widely echoed the policy changes Coinbase and we at 37signals did a few years back. So yesterday, I did two separate interviews with media outlets on the topic. And we spoke in part about those early weeks of reaction to our changes, as Twitter went crazy in response to the story. What was it like to briefly be the main, hated characters on the internet? In the moment, it was awful, but in retrospect, it was a gift.

Whether it’s deployments, secrets, configurations, or entire machines, everything exists as code somewhere. Introducing a cloud service into such an environment often means introducing additional ways to configure it, which can become cumbersome, given the rising number of cloud services modern applications depend on.7.....integreatly.grafana.integreatly..

At this point, the technical and operational benefits of cloud computing are pretty much indisputable. But the cloud industry, as a whole, still has a long way to go in one critical area: sustainability.  In fact, as shocking as it may sound, it’s estimated that cloud data centers have a greater carbon footprint than the entire aviation industry . Ida Fürjesová and Niki Manoledaki, both software engineers at Grafana Labs, are passionate about helping to change that.
