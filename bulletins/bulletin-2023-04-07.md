Uber ran a tech spec review process called the DUCK Review. “DUCK” didn’t stand for anything–it was created as a deliberate non-acronym–but was otherwise a fairly typical review process. When I first joined, we’d review one or two specs each week. The volume of requested reviews kept growing, and six months later there was a one to two week delay between requesting a review and receiving feedback. There’s no right pattern, just the most appropriate pattern for your current constraints.g.g.g.g.g.

Hermes is a distributed publish-subscribe message broker that we use at Allegro to facilitate asynchronous communication between our microservices. As our usage of Hermes has grown over time, we faced a challenge in effectively distributing the load it handles to optimize resource utilization. In this blog post, we will present the implementation of a dynamic workload balancing algorithm that we developed to address this challenge. Each event is stored in only one partition.g.g.e.

I&#39;ve been kind of quiet these past few weeks. Part of that has been from plowing a bunch of work into getting serious about how all of the /w/ posts get generated. I figure if I&#39;m going to start leaning on people to not do goofy things with their feed readers, the least I can do is make sure I&#39;m not sending them broken garbage. To really explain this, I need to back up to 2011 when this whole thing was just getting off the ground. Then people asked for an Atom feed, and I delivered on that too..

#516 – April 03, 2023 How Programming Affects Your Brain Programmers may become increasingly irritable when a puzzle takes a long time to solve, and may be hesitant to take on tasks that are too easy and do not offer enough challenge. This could be a way to differentiate between those who are addicted to programming and those who are team players, based on their willingness to perform the necessary but less exciting work that is required to complete a project.

“The self is incompatible with freedom, the way most people understand it, because the self is a constraint,” says social psychologist and professor of organizational behavior  Brian Lowery . “The ‘you’ you’re talking about is actually the relationships you have, the social interactions you have and the cultural context you exist in. He also shares research on how asking deeply personal questions can be a tool for deepening relationships.  Resources : https://www.gsb.stanford.

In the past ten years, there’s been a massive shift in the way new software is developed. The emerging cloud-native ecosystem paved the way for applications to be developed faster, better, and more reliably. DevOps gave way to GitOps. Security is shifting left. And Kubernetes is now everywhere. While those who’ve adopted Kubernetes have reaped many of its benefits, operating and managing Kubernetes clusters remains a challenge. This is where the Weave GitOps Assured Accelerator comes in... 1. 3.

Gaby, my wife, a few weeks before the birth: Before Oscar was born, I was entirely excited that we were going to have a child. I liked my life, but it was a good time to change everything. My job was fine, but I wasn’t worried about putting it on hold or even losing it. We were about to move to London, so my social circle, hobbies, and routines were going to get warped anyway. The baby is due soon. I cried.

This paper is from IBM, 1992. This is a foundational paper in databases area. ARIES achieves long-running transaction recovery in a performant/nonblocking fashion. It is more complicated than simple (write-ahead-log) WAL-based per-action-recovery, as it needs to preserve the Atomicity and Durability properties for ACID transactions. Any transactional database worth its salt (including PostGres, Oracle, MySQL) implements recovery techniques based on the ARIES principles. &#34;I have this condition...

Hello! A few years I wrote a post called A new way I’m getting feedback on my posts: beta readers! about how I’d started using beta readers. The basic strategy for getting feedback there was to email people a PDF and ask for feedback. This was kind of inefficient, and so over the past couple of years, I’ve worked a lot with Marie Flanagan to improve the process. There are some screenshots further down. First, let’s talk about some problems with the original process.

Introduction In episode 9, Miki discussed how a command flag can be decoded into a user defined type with the Value interface. As a recap, the Value interface consists of two methods: one for serializing the underlying concrete type and one for deserializing a string into an object. To put this interface to the test, Miki wrote a command that had a flag to specify a network address.

TLA⁺ is a formal specification language that is particularly effective when applied to concurrent &amp; distributed systems. TLA⁺ made it tractable for an ordinary software engineer to reason about a tricky distributed systems problem, and it found a bug introduced by an “optimization” I tried to add (classic). The bug required 12 sequential steps to occur and would not have been uncovered by ordinary testing.

These requirements conflict with each other. Here is an idea: put the tables in a schema on which the API user has no USAGE permission. Give the API user permissions on those tables. The user still cannot directly access them because of the schema permissions. Mission accomplished!

How are you able to get both? i.e. I don&#39;t want ordinary users to access underlying tables (of &#39;internal&#39; schema). They only get access to &#39;api&#39; schema, which houses all the views that query internal tables. But I would like to apply policies at table level. If I change settings of views, to have privileges of invoker, they then are unable to access internal tables. I guess my only option is to define row based access at the views level instead of at the table level?

It&#39;s been a long time since I last saw a physical piece of hardware used to run our services at 37signals . I vaguely remember doing a tour of our Chicago data center over a decade ago, but somewhere along the line, I just lost interest in the iron itself. Now the interest is back, because hardware is fun again , so let me share my excitement with you! These are the two pallets that showed up in our Chicago data center recently.75GHz with 48 cores / 96 threads. Spinning rust at 7,200 RPM.

Tim Urban&#39;s new book What&#39;s Our Problem? offers an excellent analysis of the current American political malaise. It breaks down the history of first how the Republican party got overrun by low-rung thinking from the mid-90s forward, then how equally low-rung thinking got the other side in the past decade or so. It&#39;s a light, humorous recap of modern American political history. I highly recommend it. It&#39;s central contribution is adding a second dimension to the political spectrum. Buy his book!

One of the most important techniques I&#39;ve embraced for managing my time is to direct related tasks to a bucket, let that bucket accumulate until full, then empty it all in one go. This in contrast to trying to catch every task the moment it lands from the myriad of interruption pipes that&#39;ll drip-drip-drip your day away if you let them. Nowhere is the most evident than with email. I used to take such pride in inbox zero when I was still using Gmail. Whether it was urgent or not. It was not.

## [KI: Umwälzung für die Wirtschaft garantiert](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/ki-umwaelzung-fuer-die-wirtschaft-garantiert/)


Vielen Dank an Lili Laguna für diese Übersetzung diesen niederländischen Blog-Beitrag. English version. Jeder überschlägt sich mit Vorhersagen über KI. Sie wird uns von stupider Arbeit befreien, sie wird unsere Bildung zerstören, wir alle werden nichts mehr lernen müssen, weil die KI es für uns tun wird, Kriminelle werden uns mit ihr austricksen, Gauner werden mit ihr unendliche Mengen an Desinformation erzeugen, und die KI wird entkommen und in der realen Welt gefährlich werden.

## [AI: Guaranteed to disrupt our economies](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/ai-is-guaranteed-to-disrupt-us/)


This is a machine-aided translation of this Dutch post. Und jetzt auch auf Deutsch verfügbar! Everyone is tumbling over themselves making predictions about AI. It’s going to free us from menial work, it’s going to dismantle our education, we all won’t have to learn things anymore because the AI will do it for us, criminals will trick us with it, crooks will create endless amounts of disinformation with language models, and the AI will escape and become dangerous in the real world.

Update: This article is now also available in English. Und jetzt auch auf Deutsch! Iedereen buitelt over zichzelf heen om voorspellingen te doen over AI. Het gaat ons bevrijden van dom werk, het gaat ons onderwijs ontmantelen, we hoeven allemaal dingen niet meer te leren want de AI gaat het voor ons doen, criminelen zullen ons er mee bedonderen, boeven gaan er eindeloze hoeveelheden desinformatie mee maken, en de AI zal ontsnappen en in de echte wereld gevaarlijk worden.

When building backend applications, we often have to add features that are not supported by the current stack or would slow down our applications. A possible workaround is to use cloud functions that help abstract away some of these tasks. This tutorial will cover how to create Netlify Functions, then explain an example use case, and best practices for using Netlify Functions. We will also take a look at how Netlify Functions compare to AWS Lambda and why you might prefer one over the other.dev.

One specific issue was managing the dependencies in a consistent manner across different environments – my local development machine, my teammates’ machines, and the production environment. These dependencies varied across platforms.run(host = &#39;0.0.0.txt .0.0. ↩︎

Training and using models are two separate phases (Image by author) Building models vs. using models After finishing the training phase of our models, new stages of the whole modeling pipeline get activated. The most common one within the machine-learning community is model deployment. For those who are not familiar with the concept, this basically refers to placing the model somewhere. When a car is built and assembled, “deployment” may be, for example, bringing it to car dealers’ shops.
