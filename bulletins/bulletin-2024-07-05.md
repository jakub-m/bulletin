A database does not need a write-ahead log (WAL) to achieve durability. A database can write its long-term data structure durably to disk before returning to a client. Granted, this is a bad idea! And granted, a WAL is critical for durability by design in most databases. But I think it&#39;s helpful to understand WALs by understanding what you could do without them. So let&#39;s look at what terrible design we can make for a durable database that has no write-ahead log. Let&#39;s start from the beginning.e.

“What people regret over time are things they didn’t do. They didn’t take that trip, they didn’t ask that person out on a date. They didn’t start that business,” says former political speechwriter and author Dan Pink . “I think it’s because we are slightly over-indexed on risk. We overstate the risk in many circumstances. “There’s almost incontrovertible evidence that a sense of purpose is the most cost-effective performance enhancer that organizations have,” Pink says.

Hello! Today someone on Mastodon asked about job control ( fg , bg , Ctrl&#43;z , wait , etc). It made me think about how I don’t use my shell’s job control interactively very often: usually I prefer to just open a new terminal tab if I want to run multiple terminal programs, or use tmux if it’s over ssh. But I was curious about whether other people used job control more often than me. So I asked on Mastodon for reasons people use job control. This is the normal state when you start a process.7...1.

In a previous post I talked about how each Go module is its own self-contained &#34;virtual environment&#34; during development. Among other benefits, this makes the dependencies of a module explicit and simple to tweak. Locally patching a dependency To use a concrete example, suppose our module depends on the popular package go-cmp , that lets us deep-compare arbitrary Go values.g. &#34;do I ever invoke cmp.

## [Unanimous 2PC: Fault-tolerant Distributed Transactions Can be Fast and Simple](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/07/unanimous-2pc-fault-tolerant.html)


This paper (PAPOC&#39;24) is a cute paper. It isn&#39;t practical or very novel, but I  think it is a good thought-provoking paper. It did bring together the work/ideas around transaction commit for me. It also has TLA&#43; specs in the appendix, which could be helpful to you in your modeling adventures.  I don&#39;t like the paper&#39;s introduction and motivation sections, so I will explain these my way. The problem with 2PC 2PC is a commit protocol. Below  figure shows 2PC in action. Y says yes.

## [Optimizing Distributed Protocols with Query Rewrites](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/06/optimizing-distributed-protocols-with.html)


This paper (Sigmod 2024) formalizes scalability optimizations as rule-driven rewrites, inspired by SQL query optimizations. It focuses on two well-known and popular techniques: decoupling (distributing logic/code across nodes for introducing pipeline parallelism) and partitioning (distributing data across nodes--no new components, but instances of them-- for workload parallelism). Whittaker et al. This is a simple but effective trick.g., compartmentalized Paxos).

At its core, observability is about helping humans understand and optimize complex systems. It enables engineering teams to ask questions on the fly, and to learn not only when something goes wrong but why . Observability also allows organizations to proactively identify and address performance issues — before their end users even have a chance to notice. To do this effectively, you need to understand the intended users or audience for your dashboard. Errors: the rate of requests that fail (e.g.

In other words, we want to make observability still human, but less complicated. (Our second use case? Making social media more fun .)

Species that you had been noticing disappear may have been replaced by ones that hadn’t been there before. Or you may have seen migrating birds on the wing—say, a flock of geese flying in their famous V-formation. Even if you’re not a dedicated birder, you’ve probably made such observations throughout your life.

## [The Best Bionic Leg Yet](https://spectrum.ieee.org/prosthetic-leg)


For the first time, a small group of patients with amputations below the knee were able to control the movements of their prosthetic legs through neural signals—rather than relying on programmed cycles for all or part of a motion—and resume walking with a natural gait. The achievement required a specialized amputation surgery combined with a non-invasive surface electrode connection to a robotic prosthetic lower leg. “What happens then is quite miraculous. It’s natural. Video 1 www.youtube.”

## [Shipt’s Algorithm Squeezed Gig Workers. They Fought Back](https://spectrum.ieee.org/shipt)


In early 2020, gig workers for the app-based delivery company Shipt noticed something strange about their paychecks. The company, which had been acquired by Target in 2017 for US $550 million, offered same-day delivery from local stores. Those deliveries were made by Shipt workers, who shopped for the items and drove them to customers’ doorsteps. They were doing the same work they’d always done, yet their paychecks were often less than they expected. And they didn’t know why.D.

## [Persona AI Brings Calm Experience to the Hectic Humanoid Industry](https://spectrum.ieee.org/persona-ai-radford-pratt)


It may at times seem like there are as many humanoid robotics companies out there as the industry could possibly sustain, but the potential for useful and reliable and affordable humanoids is so huge that there’s plenty of room for any company that can actually get them to work. He also founded Jacobi Motors, which is commercializing variable flux electric motors. Jerry Pratt worked on walking robots for 20 years at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition ( IHMC ) in Pensacola, Florida.

## [This Wearable Computer Made a Fashion Statement](https://spectrum.ieee.org/wearable-computer)


In 1993, well before Google Glass debuted , the artist Lisa Krohn designed a prototype wearable computer that looked like no other. The Cyberdesk was an experiment in augmented reality. At a time when computers were mostly beige and boxy , Krohn envisioned a pliable, high-tech garment that fused fashion with function., in 1988. What is Lisa Krohn’s Cyberdesk? Although a working prototype of the Cyberdesk was never built, the yellow eyepiece suggested a retinal display. Cyberdesk 2.0.

## [Why Not Give Robots Foot-Eyes?](https://spectrum.ieee.org/robot-camera-feet)


This article is part of our exclusive IEEE Journal Watch series in partnership with IEEE Xplore. One of the (many) great things about robots is that they don’t have to be constrained by how their biological counterparts do things. But how far can you take this? I have no idea, but it seems like we haven’t gotten to the end of things yet because now there’s a quadruped with cameras on the bottom of its feet . The whole thing is sealed to keep out dirt and water.

## [Scaling Compute to Satiate AI](https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-scaling)


Fifty years ago, DRAM inventor and IEEE Medal of Honor recipient Robert Dennard created what essentially became the semiconductor industry’s path to perpetually increasing transistor density and chip performance. That path became known as Dennard scaling, and it helped codify Gordon Moore’s postulate about device dimensions shrinking by half every 18 to 24 months. For decades it compelled engineers to push the physical limits of semiconductor devices. On a visit to GlobalFoundries in Malta, N.Y.
