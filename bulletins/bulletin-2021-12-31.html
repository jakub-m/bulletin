                                A number of LastPass users recently received an email like the following, indicating that someone else attempted to log into their account: The mail is legitimate and has been sent out by the LastPass service. The location however was typically very far away from the user‚Äôs actual location, e.g. in a country like Brazil or India. Yet this isn‚Äôt merely an attempt to guess the password, as LastPass will only send a mail like this one if the correct master password is provided in the login attempt.

                                Recently a security hole in a certain open source Java library resulted in a worldwide emergency kerfuffle as, say, 40% of the possibly hundreds of millions of worldwide deployments of this library needed to be updated in a hurry. (The other 60% also needed to be updated in a hurry, but won&#39;t be until they facilitate some ransomware, which is pretty normal for these situations.) I have a 20&#43; year history of poking fun at Java in this space, and it pains me to stop now...&#34; Suddenly, oh, crap...

                                Last year I rolled up the newsletter into an ebook and gave my thoughts on every published blogpost. I haven‚Äôt gotten around to making the 2021 Computer Things volume, so we‚Äôll just run through the blog posts this time. I wrote about 39,000 words for the blog, which is about 8,000 less than last year. But I also released a 20 minute video, and was horrifically depressed for half the year, so I‚Äôm not too broken-up over it. I was disappointed with how little of a splash it made at the time. Shit.

                                In Bullshit Jobs: A Theory, David Graeber makes the case that a sizable chunk of the labour economy is essentially people performing useless work, as a sort of subconscious self-preservation instinct of the economic status quo. The book cites ample anecdotal evidence that people perceive their own jobs as completely disconnected from any sort of value creation, and makes the case that the ruling class stands to lose from the proletariat having extra free time on their hands.

                                The relationship between the CEO and Head of Product is one of the most important pillars of a scaling startup. The CEO is most startups‚Äô original Head of Product ‚Äì setting the roadmap, hiring PMs, defining the features that you‚Äôll build. But as a company grows it becomes too complex to manage both the complexities of the Product organization and everything else on a CEO‚Äôs plate. Defining this relationship understandably leads to challenges. You can‚Äôt keep your baby at home forever.

We use this blog to provide all sorts of information, from technical walk-throughs to news about product launches and forthcoming events.

By virtue of being in a very large company, we had quite the assortment of libraries which could be brought in to do stuff. Given that we had a &#34;would be nice&#34; item on our feature list that involved doing something with the filesystem, I went looking for a matching feature, and it turned into a security dumpster fire. Here&#39;s what happened. It won&#39;t work... and so on down the line...are.

Using Password123 is worthy of a good laugh, but there are other passwords that are used everyday: SSH keys and other tokens used to access critical infrastructure. Teleport recently commissioned a survey of 1000 IT, DevOps and Security professionals and found that passwords are the number one way of managing access to infrastructure. This is a problem.

                                Most car purchases start with a test drive. Increasingly, enterprise software purchases (including security software) are made the same way. These evaluations are often called a Proof of Concept or PoC. This term is a great fit for lots of situations, especially when the solution evolves a novel way of combining established tools or a hard-to-define use case that can only be judged in practice. Instead, we should talk in terms of a Proof of Value. 1. 3. 4. 5.

When evaluating opportunities, I always ask myself two questions: Will this opportunity enable me to do good (i.e. ‚Äúmake the world a better place‚Äù)? Will this opportunity enable me to be great (i.e. build valuable skills and execute at a high level)? Let‚Äôs look at each of these. Do good. Build an effective solution. Make the solution accessible .g. Be great.
