In the era of ubiquitous cloud services and an increasingly growing PaaS and serverless-oriented approach, performance and resources seem to be becoming less and less important. After all, we can scale horizontally and vertically at any time, without worrying about potential performance challenges that the business may introduce. However, there is also another side to the coin – rising costs. A similar situation arises with databases. This prompted us to look for solutions.18 $31.blob.core.

My Favorite Bits of OSDI/ATC&#39;23 Talking to 3D people is cool again. This week brought USENIX ATC&#39;23 and OSDI&#39;23 together in Boston. While I&#39;ve followed OSDI and ATC papers for years, it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve been to either of them (I&#39;ve have been to NSDI a couple times). It was a really good time. In this post I&#39;ll cover a couple of my favorite papers 1 , and trends I noticed. This year at OSDI, pretty much everybody I talked to was building in Rust. There&#39;s a lot more to do here.

This is the part-1 of a three-part blog post series in which we outline how we addressed inventory challenges through product, machine learning, and engineering innovations. A few years ago, we introduced the problem of predicting the availability of grocery items . In the last couple of years, fueled by the pandemic and supply chain issues, being able to get an accurate sense of availability has become table stakes for both Instacart’s customers and the company.

I like to challenge myself with special projects and new research areas. Sometimes these goals take a few months to complete, other times they last years. One of my long-term projects has been focused on automating my network defenses and reducing the system administrative overhead. Early on, I noticed that the sheer number of network attacks against my servers was consuming way too much of my time. Risk assessments, responses, investigations, etc. were becoming a full-time job.ipv4.ipv6.icmp.

One of the first leadership books I read was Patrick Lencioni’s The Five Dysfunctions of a Team , which introduces the concept of your peers being your “first team” rather than your direct reports. This was a powerful idea for me, because it’s much harder to be a good teammate to your peers than to your direct reports. While your incentives are usually aligned with the team you manage, it’s very common for your incentives to be at odds with your peers’ incentives.g. Establish team structure.

So when I heard about a new(-ish) DSL for concrete syntax trees (CST), I couldn&#39;t resist playing with it a bit. Ungrammar is used in rust-analyzer to define and access a CST for Rust. This blog post by its creator provides much more details. According to the author, Ungrammar is &#34;the ASDL for concrete syntax trees&#34;. The result is go-ungrammar , a re-implementation of Ungrammar in Go.

With the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), for the first time, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) became accessible to everyday developers. Apps that feel magical, even software that was practically impossible to build by big technology companies with billions in R&amp;D spend, suddenly became not only possibly, but a joy to build and share. The surge in building with AI started in 2021, grew rapidly in 2022, and exploded in the first half of 2023.g.g.. * NodePad.

One of the core joys of mathematical thinking is how sometimes, once you frame a problem the right way, the solution becomes obvious. Think of Euler inventing graph theory to trivially solve a complex-seeming problem . This post describes another graph trick. The practice of software is bursting with graphs. One I&#39;ve touched a lot in my career is the dependency graph . These collections of edges form a directed graph. Sometimes we want to visualize or understand these graphs.

People don’t change their minds. Well, sometimes they do, but it’s a slow process, and people almost never change their mind because you convinced them to. Journeys of self-discovery, traumatic events, and loss of faith in leaders are much more likely to change minds than arguments. This idea is backed by psychology, experience, and all sorts of other empirical data - we know that facts don’t change minds. Ensure that people who disagree are broadly OK with disagreeing and committing.

Hello! Here’s a new entry in the “cool software julia likes” section. A little while ago I started using a Mac, and one of my biggest frustrations with it is that often I need to run Linux-specific software. For example, the nginx playground I posted about the other day only works on Linux because it uses Linux namespaces (via bubblewrap ) to sandbox nginx. And I’m working on another playground right now that uses bubblewrap too. It was surprisingly simple to set up.lima/default/lima.8.8.8.8.8.

When the marital infidelity website AshleyMadison.com learned in July 2015 that hackers were threatening to publish data stolen from 37 million users, the company’s then-CEO Noel Biderman was quick to point the finger at an unnamed former contractor. But as a new documentary series on Hulu reveals [SPOILER ALERT!], there was just one problem with that theory: Their top suspect had killed himself more than a year before the hackers began publishing stolen user data.

Posted by Jerry Wei, Student Researcher, and Denny Zhou, Principal Scientist, Google Research A key feature of human intelligence is that humans can learn to perform new tasks by reasoning using only a few examples. Scaling up language models has unlocked a range of new applications and paradigms in machine learning, including the ability to perform challenging reasoning tasks via in-context learning . Symbol-tuned models are much stronger at algorithmic reasoning tasks.g., “Foo,” “Bar,” etc.).
