## [Bit Hacking (with Go code)](https://lemire.me/blog/2023/02/07/bit-hacking-with-go-code/)


At a fundamental level, a programmer needs to manipulate bits. Modern processors operate over data by loading in ‘registers’ and not individual bits. Thus a programmer must know how to manipulate the bits within a register. Generally, we can do so while programming with 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit integers. For example, suppose that I … Continue reading Bit Hacking (with Go code)

The Go Blog Profile-guided optimization preview Michael Pratt 8 February 2023 When you build a Go binary, the Go compiler performs optimizations to try to generate the best performing binary it can. For example, constant propagation can evaluate constant expressions at compile time, avoiding runtime evaluation cost. Escape analysis avoids heap allocations for locally-scoped objects, avoiding GC overheads. Go improves optimizations from release to release, but this is not always an easy task.....

Do you remember your backlog ever shrinking? Of course you don’t. Backlogs never shrink. Backlogs never shrink because the list of things we’d eventually like to do never shrinks, and that’s what backlogs are: a bunch of unimportant tasks that we’ll eventually get to, but not today. Important tasks never go into the backlog. We create them, we work on them, and we ship them. I’m sure the answer will be a resounding “never” . Context-sharing and organization alignment will. No, they won’t.com .

There are still green fields, but the fundraising rampage of the last few years has birthed viable startups in almost every category. Unless you’re lucky enough to be the first and strongest entrant in your sector, you will need to fight a bigger competitor. Let’s talk about a few of the ways to challenge a larger incumbent.

‘Another way of doing cloud computing’ is how Kubernetes was described when it first came into the picture back in 2014. Until then software was built on monolithic code, making it a challenging task for developers to make even the smallest of changes. From there came microservices - a concept of writing code in smaller pieces. Each piece was processed in smaller computer-like virtual machines (VMs). An upgrade from this was containerization with the principle of ‘write once and run anywhere.e.

At Dropbox, we store data about how people use our products and services in a Hadoop-based data lake. Various teams rely on the information in this data lake for all kinds of business purposes—for example, analytics, billing, and developing new features—and our job is to make sure that only good quality data reaches the lake.  Our data lake is over 55 petabytes in size, and quality is always a big concern when working with data at this scale. Both have their problems. 🙂 Simple enough? Yes.

## [Tailscale for DevOps: Give CodeSandbox access to private resources on your tailnet](https://tailscale.com/blog/codesandbox/)


Developing software in an IDE like CodeSandbox requires access to many on-prem or cloud resources, from package and container image registries to databases. When you’re using CodeSandbox for remote development, you’ll want to access those resources securely and with the lowest possible latency — even if they’re behind a firewall or don’t have public IP addresses. Network admins can generate a key from the  Keys page  of the admin console.

To produce this episode, Matt typed his questions to ask ChatGPT, then recorded them in the studio. Producers then used Descript Overdub to &#34;read&#34; ChatGPT&#39;s responses. Seuss rhyme. ChatGPT provides advice on deep breathing, being confident, and speaking with pride.

This paper appeared in VLDB2022 and is a good followup to our TPC-E vs TPC-C post . The paper investigates the following question: Many articles compare to prior works under certain settings, but how much of their conclusions hold under other settings? Their methodology is as follows. They used TPC-C and YCSB benchmarks as they are most widely used. They reproduced and evaluated 11 work (see Table 1). They make some recommendations as to how to proceed for evaluation of future systems work.e.g.

I’m a professional computer programmer, but I don’t often do all that much computer programming.

This makes it easy to forget how much fun it is to write a long program that truly interests you and watch it do something a little bit astonishing.

A higher-order function is a function that takes other functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result. Higher-order functions are an exceptionally powerful software design tool because they can easily create new abstractions and are composable. In this post I will present a case study - a set of functions that defines an interesting problem domain. One of my all-time favorite programming books is Peter Norvig&#39;s PAIP . In section 6.

The modern software delivery life cycle is filled with microservices packed into containers. Containers can lead to more flexible and scalable applications but often at the cost of additional complexity. Your application probably consists of many microservices that are built and deployed independently. Each microservice may have its own development and deployment cycle, and the dependencies between services can be complex. This is where container orchestrators can help.

Many people were supportive, but there were of course the usual drive-by claims by developers that the bugs were trivial, they would’ve found &amp; fixed them inside of 20 minutes, and I was laughably incompetent for having written them in the first place.

External scanners use handwritten C or C&#43;&#43; code to parse the non-context-free parts of your language.

Introduction In episode 1, Miki had two functions that performed the similar operation, but returned different types. To refactor this, Miki rewrote both functions as a generic function that allowed him to specify the type to be returned during invocation. In some cases, the compiler may not recognise a type, thus, Miki gives a few pointers on manually telling a generic function which type to use.

Disappointment occurs when expectations don’t match reality. And our expectations for software quality are profoundly unrealistic. Thus, lots of people are continuously disappointed — even enraged — by software bugs. They shouldn’t be. The only reliable, widely used way to ensure impeccable software quality is to write less software that does less stuff, and then spend eons honing that tiny lot. Software development doesn’t work like that. Bugs are an inevitable byproduct of writing software.

Now comes the proof that we&#39;ve indeed seen the corporate peak.

Authorities in the United States and United Kingdom today levied financial sanctions against seven men accused of operating &#34;Trickbot,&#34; a cybercrime-as-a-service platform based in Russia that has enabled countless ransomware attacks and bank account takeovers since its debut in 2016. The U.S. Department of the Treasury says the Trickbot group is associated with Russian intelligence services, and that this alliance led to the targeting of many U.S. companies and government entities.

Posted by Ted White and Ofer Naaman, Staff Research Scientists, Google Quantum AI The Google Quantum AI team is building quantum computers with superconducting microwave circuits, but much like a classical computer the superconducting processor at the heart of these computers is only part of the story. An entire technology stack of peripheral hardware is required to make the quantum computer work properly. We therefore cannot afford to average the signal over a longer time to reduce the noise.

You can find other posts in the series here.) The explosion in deep learning a decade ago was catapulted in part by the convergence of new algorithms and architectures, a marked increase in data, and access to greater compute. But, it is unclear precisely how the “world knowledge” of such models interacts with the presented context.e.e.g.e.
