You acquire a skill or experience through time and effort, then downplay the impact of writing and sharing the learning process. Professionals seem naturally to imagine a high bar for what is worth writing about. I think that&#39;s misguided. This article is not criticism of folks with these beliefs, but rather encouragement for folks looking for a reason to write. There are (at least) a few concrete reasons to write about what you&#39;ve learned, even when it&#39;s not novel. Daily, really. If I can.io .

Here’s weird thing about me: I’m pro-dynamic types. This is weird because I’m also pro-formal methods, in fact teach formal methods as a career, which seems completely antithetical. So on one hand I teach people how to do static analysis, on the other I use languages which make static analysis impossible. My fondness for dynamic types is ultimately more social than technical: Python helped me escape academia and my first two jobs were in Ruby. I think this approach is ultimately bankrupt. 1 .  ↩

Back when I was managing at Uber, I latched onto a thinking tool that I drilled into the teams I worked with: reach the right outcomes by prioritizing the company first, your team second, and yourself third. This company/team/self framework proved itself a helpful decision-making tool, and almost always led to the “correct” outcome. As I’ve become a more experienced manager, I’ve stopped giving this advice. People are complex, and they get energy in complex ways. That’s great. That’s great, too.

## [Vertical Paxos and Primary-Backup Replication](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/12/vertical-paxos-and-primary-backup.html)


This is a 2009 paper by Leslie Lamport, Dahlia Malkhi, and Lidong Zhou. This paper was very well written and it was clear, and easy to follow (at least for me after having read so many Paxos papers). I finished reading the paper in one hour -- a record time for a slow reader like me. I knew about this work, but had not read the paper carefully before. The downside is that, the configuration master itself would have to be implemented as a Paxos group for fault-tolerance. That came later in 2016.

## [The World of Yesterday: a brief review of a 1942 book](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/the-world-of-yesterday/)


A brief review of Stefan Zweig’s 1942 book “Die Welt von Gestern: Erinnerungen eines Europäers”, which I read in the earlier English translation by Benjamin W. Huebsch and Helmut Ripperger (public domain copy). There is also a more recent translation by Anthea Bell, The World of Yesterday: Memoirs of a European. It too appears to be excellent.

I am not a car person, which is to say both that I don&#39;t know much about cars and also that I am generally not excited by them. With that important credibility-disqualifying background up front, let me tell you about a car we bought that I am unexpectedly happy with. (It&#39;s my first new car ever! All my previous cars were bought used.) When we moved to the suburbs we brought with us the single car our family had been using. It&#39;s super easy to park in the city because it&#39;s so short.

Tenancy is a topic that is not discussed as much as it should be, and yet, it is one of the most important parts of making cloud-native operational at scale. Every organization deals with numerous teams, projects, applications, partners, and customers. These groups of people or ideas, or objects often share a common underlying infrastructure. In doing so, they become tenants of each other. Managing these tenants is key to ensuring the success of an organization.

Introduction Apache Kafka is an open-sourced event streaming platform where users can create Kafka topics as data transmission units, and then publish or subscribe to the topic with producers and consumers. While most of the Kafka topics are actively used, some are not needed anymore because business needs changed or the topics themselves are ephemeral. Kafka itself doesn’t have a mechanism to automatically detect unused topics and delete them. However, if the […]

At CircleCI, it’s vital that we meet our users where they are, and many of our users are on GitLab. We were happy to make it possible for our users to build, test, and deploy via the GitLab platform. The experience had to contain everything a user would need to complete their journey with no manual interventions. Continuous delivery was critical during this phase.

SVE has a trick: it hides its … Continue reading How big are your SVE registers ? (AWS Graviton)

## [Generic number compression (zstd)](https://lemire.me/blog/2022/11/28/generic-number-compression-zstd/)


I have done a lot of work that involves compressing and uncompressing data. Most often, I work on data that has specific characteristics, e.g., sorted integers. In such cases, one can do much better than generic compression routines (e.g., zstd, gzip) both in compression ratios and performance. But how well do these generic techniques do … Continue reading Generic number compression (zstd)

You sometimes feel the need to make all of your integers positive, without losing any information. That is, you want to map all of your integers from ‘signed’ integers (e.g., -1, 1, 3, -3) to ‘unsigned integers’ (e.g., 3,2,6,7). This could be useful if you have a fast function to compress integers that fails to … Continue reading Making all your integers positive with zigzag encoding

Great data-science blog posts come in all shapes, formats, and reading times; it takes a lot of skill to produce a short and effective tutorial or a quick, well-scoped explainer! The TDS team does have a soft spot for those longer, thought-provoking articles our authors excel at writing, though—and we’ve published a particularly impressive crop of these in recent weeks. They cover a wide range of topics and approaches, and do so with patience, passion, and attention to detail.e.

 Yet, with a long-lived data product also come the unavoidable and often unanticipated problems related to data drift and bit rot. Data drift (also referred to as concept drift in the Data Science Community) is the change in the statistical properties of data over time . For Data Scientists, data drift can affect the accuracy and timeliness of your models. Data pipelines are implemented using software, either directly or indirectly, and thus are susceptible to bit rot. So, change is inevitable.
