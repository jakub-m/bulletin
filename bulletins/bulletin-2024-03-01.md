Mastodon While I’m in no way a Mastodon power user, I’ve really been enjoying the content that I get from my very limited Mastodon feed. I recently stopped consuming news from – hold on let’s not call it news. I recently stopped consuming useless information from a site that I won’t name. Everyone has those junk, just-for-fun sites they visit to blow off stream. You don’t have to be proud of them, and it’s fine that you visit them; every part of every day need not be productive.

The late George Shores was my assigned mentor for an academic competition. Winning it may well have been the first event in a virtuous cycle, setting me up for a tremendous amount of opportunity. Learning of his death made me reflect on the ways in which relatively small acts of altruism can make a huge impact.

Milestones on the timeline A new timeline design layers in details to give a more accurate overview of project progress. Milestones will now appear on project bars as long as they have a target or completion date. Represented by diamonds, milestones indicate status and can be hovered over or clicked on to show details. Milestones near each other collapse into a set, like on a map app. You can change a milestone&#39;s target date from the timeline view by dragging it to a new date.

This was the tagline of Ethereum, and it’s really smart. Sadly, I feel they have lost their way with Proof of Stake, and wish they would go back to focusing on building a reasonable world computer. In 2024, it’s still painfully annoying to stand up a database. This is the only thing big tech really has, to the point that I often use Google Sheets or a GitHub repo effectively as a database. Another fact about databases is that the world only needs one of them. This is way too small.

Author Jeffrey Archer flies out to Portugal each December to begin a seven-week writing marathon. Over the following few weeks, he will start writing at 6:00 am and will write throughout the day every day. At the end of those few weeks, he will have the first draft of his next book written. Jeffrey Archer is not measuring the number of words he writes each day. He focuses on being at his desk and writing by 6:00 am . It’s a simple formula based on just turning up daily. There is no other way.

One of the common responses was &#34;This looks really interesting but I don&#39;t know where I&#39;d use it.&#34; For Picat there was a gap of five years between me hearing about it and actually learning it. The same is true for most of the weird stuff I encounter: I keep it in the back of my head for years until I finally run into the problem which justifies using it. What he sees are merely weird languages. So I learned Picat and it solved the problem.....  ↩

What would you say is the first microcomputer? 1 The Apple I from 1976? The Altair 8800 from 1974? Perhaps the lesser-known Micral N (1973) or Q1 (1972)? How about the Arma Micro Computer from way back in 1962. The Arma Micro Computer was a compact 20-pound transistorized computer, designed for applications in space such as inertial or celestial navigation, steering, radar, or engine control. But it&#39;s an interesting computer in many ways. (Taking up just 0. Photo courtesy of Daniel Plotnick.e.

Why resistance isn’t always a bad thing. Friction — that’s Professor Huggy Rao ’s metaphor for the forces that hamper workplace efficiency. But as he says, some friction can be helpful — if you know how to use it. In his book, The Friction Project: How Smart Leaders Make the Right Things Easier and the Wrong Things Harder , Rao and coauthor Robert I. Sutton explore how operational obstacles show up in the workplace and, more importantly, what we can do about them.

By Jose Fernandez Today, we are thrilled to announce the release of bpftop , a command-line tool designed to streamline the performance optimization and monitoring of eBPF programs. As Netflix increasingly adopts eBPF [ 1 , 2 ], applying the same rigor to these applications as we do to other managed services is imperative. Striking a balance between eBPF’s benefits and system load is crucial, ensuring it enhances rather than hinders our operational efficiency.

This is an adaptation of an internal doc I wrote for Wave . I used to think that behavioral interviews were basically useless, because it was too easy for candidates to bullshit them and too hard for me to tell what was a good answer. I’d end up grading every candidate as an “okay, I guess” because I was never sure what bar I should hold them to. I still think most behavioral interviews are like that, but after grinding out way too many of them, I now think it’s possible to escape that trap.

I’ve been hearing at workshops and at Ardan how people are experiencing Out Of Memory (OOM) problems with their PODs when setting K8s memory limits. I’m often told that when an OOM occurs, K8s will terminate and restart the POD. I wanted to experience an OOM, but I was also curious about three other things.

I was wondering how easy it would be to run Gemma on my computer, chat with it and interact with it from a Go program. Turns it - thanks to Ollama - it&#39;s extremely easy! Gemma was already added to Ollama , so all one has to do is run: $ ollama run gemma And wait for a few minutes while the model downloads.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms&#34; &#34;github. Parse () llm , err := ollama .

I remember the first application that I self-hosted, BugTracker.NET . It’s ancient now, but this was in 2009. I had just landed my second job out of undergrad. I went from being an incredibly underpaid computer programmer focusing on one of Microsoft’s now-legacy ERP systems, Dynamics AX, and development on top of Microsoft SQL Server to being a system administrator for that same ERP system for a new company at more than double the pay. This was a huge spend for them. I needed it though.NET.g.8.

Atomicity does not mean that something is executed as one instruction at the hardware level with some magic in the circuitry preventing it from being interrupted. Atomicity merely conveys the impression that this is the case, for it has only two outcomes: the specified result or nothing at all, which means in particular that it is free of side effects. Ensuring atomicity becomes trickier as faults and failures are involved. Each block is written to two places, A and B, on disk.2. Real actions.

Malicious hackers are targeting people in the cryptocurrency space in attacks that start with a link added to the target’s account at Calendly, a popular free calendar application for scheduling appointments and meetings. The attackers impersonate established cryptocurrency investors and ask to schedule a video conference call. But clicking the meeting link provided by the scammers prompts the user to run a script that quietly installs malware on macOS systems.

I always thought it was a software problem — or at least a difference of aesthetics expressed in software. But it turns out  the reason many Mac owners, including yours truly, so strongly dislike how fonts typically look on Windows is actually a hardware problem!   See, every Mac with a screen has since 2018 shipped with a retina-class display . That means a pixel-per-inch count in excess of 218. High enough that you can&#39;t see the individual pixels with the naked eye. And that&#39;s the magic.

Some programmers can code under any conditions. Open office? They&#39;ll bring headphones. Whatever editor is on their system? They&#39;ll make it work. Using a different framework or language every few years? No problem. I envy that level of versatility, but I&#39;ve come to accept it just isn&#39;t me. I bond with a quiet room, an editor, and a programming environment far more deeply than that.   Case in point, I&#39;ve been using the TextMate programming editor since it was first created back in 2004.

In addition to trying out Windows for a week, I also switched my main phone number to Android recently. And that turned out to be far easier. Dangerously easy, you might say, if you were in Apple’s shoes. But it’s all down to how deep you’re mired in the platform services soup. I used to be all-in on the Apple software story. Apple Mail, Apple Calendar, Apple Notes, Apple Photos, iMessage, Apple Just-About-Everything. It’s really hard to switch from iPhone to Android when that’s the case.

Hell, not just viable, but better in many regards. Now it’s true that to get this kind of speed, you need to rock a desktop machine.1.

On 23 October 1916, an engineer named Henry E. Warren quietly revolutionized power transmission by installing an electric clock in the L Street generating station of Boston’s Edison Electric Illuminating Co. This master station clock kept a very particular type of time: It used a synchronous self-starting motor in conjunction with a pendulum to help maintain the station’s AC electricity at a steady 60-cycle-per-second frequency. Until the late 1940s, station clocks from the Warren Telechron Co.

Diesel cars are a popular choice for those looking to buy a used vehicle in Asia, Europe, and elsewhere. After all, diesel cars cost less to maintain, burn less fuel, and have a longer engine life. Although the pollutant emissions of a diesel engine are less than those of a gasoline one, it still emits carcinogens, nitrous oxides, and soot. Older models don’t even have the emission-control features that newer ones do. Gases pass through either double or multiple chambers.S. dollars.

CMOS, the silicon logic technology behind decades and decades of smaller transistors and faster computers, is entering a new phase. CMOS uses two types of transistors in pairs to limit a circuit’s power consumption. In this new phase, “CMOS 2.0,” that part’s not going to change, but how processors and other complex CMOS chips are made will. Why is CMOS entering a new phase? Julien Ryckaert: CMOS was the technology answer to build microprocessors in the 1960s. But that has started to break down.”
