Practical distributed applications are deployed into varied environments and execute on a variety of different machines linked together over a variety of communication infrastructure. The physical machines themselves can differ in the number and speed of processors, the availability of random access and stable storage, and more. The communication infrastructure can differ in the available levels of latency, throughput, and reliability.

Continuing the recent theme of blog posts about Go tooling , this post will briefly discuss how analysis tools interact with one of Go&#39;s newest features - generics. As usual, this post provides a motivating example and discusses a couple of approaches to writing a tool. The full code is on GitHub . As a motivating example, let&#39;s find all calls to generic functions in a module, and the instantiated type arguments for that call. We&#39;ll use this code sample: package main import &#34;golang.Info.Type.

SQLite is the most widely deployed database engine (or likely even software of any type) in existence. It is found in nearly every smartphone (iOS and Android), computer, web browser, television, and automobile. There are likely over one trillion SQLite databases in active use. (If you are on a Mac laptop, you can open a terminal, type &#34;sqlite3&#34;, and start conversing with the SQLite database engine using SQL.

Over the past few years, server-side request forgery (SSRF) has received an increasing amount of attention from security researchers. With SSRF, an attacker can retarget a request to internal services and exploit the implicit trust within the network. It often escalates into a critical vulnerability, and in 2021 it was among the top ten web application security risks identified by the Open Web Application Security Project. This means an attacker’s access would be limited.dropbox.dropbox.dropbox.

Open source is in Tailscale’s bones. After our seed round, when we were only five people making our initial open source plans, we each already had decades of experience writing and using community software. Personally, I’m a Unix programmer only because of a Slackware CD I picked up in Hong Kong in 1995. I owe my livelihood and a big part of my identity to open source. Beyond our instincts to build open source software, we also couldn’t have built Tailscale without it. We get that.

## [Now with more DERP](https://tailscale.com/blog/more-derp/)


Tailscale clients make direct connections to each other, almost all the time . To do that, they need reliable communication infrastructure to determine how to connect (using DISCO packets), and a communication path of last resort to use when the local network on one or both ends is hostile enough that direct connections are not feasible. Tailscale runs a global network of DERP relay servers to cover both of these needs. That means you can more quickly and easily establish network connections.

Background Deployment frequency and lead time for changes are a measure of how an elite organization can deliver software on-demand to its users; at the same time, keeping failure and recovery rates low. With many developers now embracing this new trend, the decentralized nature of cloud infrastructure has significantly increased the threat landscape; thus raising many security issues and concerns many companies grapple with. One method we introduce is Trusted application delivery .

When rolling out a new version of your application, traffic routing is one of the trickiest challenges. Progressive delivery is a way to get the best of both worlds - stable releases, and higher release velocity. Exposing a subset of users to the new version during the evaluation period and keeping other users in the previous version is the gist of progressive delivery. One of the most complicated challenges among these is traffic routing. This method carries a low-risk factor.

Microservice architecture is an application system design pattern in which an entire business application is composed of individual functional scoped services, which can scale on demand. Each team focuses on an individual service and builds it according to their skillset or language of choice. Before the microservices era, enterprises built their applications using monolithic design patterns, which ran on an on-site, high-capacity server (data center). Next is a brief overview of such patterns.

Posted by Carlos Esteves and Ameesh Makadia, Research Scientists, Google Research A long-standing problem in the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics, view synthesis is the task of creating new views of a scene from multiple pictures of that scene. This has received increased attention [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] since the introduction of neural radiance fields (NeRF). In this post, we present recently published deep learning models for view synthesis. These models have some unique features.

On today&#39;s IPv6 Buzz podcast we explore DHCPv6 Option 108. Option 108 basically allows a DHCP server to use IPv4 to contact a host and tell that host to disable its IPv4 stack and switch to IPv6-only. In other words, you&#39;re using IPv4 to turn off IPv4. We examine the use cases for this peculiar capability. The post IPv6 Buzz 110: The Peculiar Power Of DHCPv6 Option 108 appeared first on Packet Pushers .
