From Leslie Lamport&#39;s Specifying Systems : You should be suspicious if [the model checker] does not find a violation of a liveness property... you should also be suspicious if [it] finds no errors when checking safety properties. This is specifically in the context of model-checking a formal specification, but it&#39;s a widely applicable software principle. It&#39;s not enough for a program to work, it has to work for the right reasons . Hence, BSOS: Be Suspicious of Success . Be suspicious of success.

Recently, I&#39;ve been hearing a lot of experienced PostgreSQL users reiterate this line: &#34; pg_dump is not a backup tool.&#34; In fact, the documentation has recently been updated to avoid saying that it is a backup tool, to widespread relief. Experienced PostgreSQL users and developers have been publicly called out for having the temerity to assert that pg_dump is, in fact, a backup tool. I find this narrative deeply frustrating, for two reasons. Read more »

Introduction: Welcome to Episode 2 of JSON for Engineers! In this episode, we explore the unique characteristics of JSON as a schema-less format, discussing both its benefits and challenges. You’ll learn how JSON’s flexibility, while enabling rapid development, can create issues when working with strongly-typed languages like Go. Additionally, we’ll cover the differences between JSON and more compact binary formats, and how to handle JSON’s broader use in web applications.

The inner workings of social influence and persuasion. Want to change someone’s mind? First, explains Robert Cialdini , you have to change their framing. For Cialdini, the Regent&#39;s Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Marketing at Arizona State University, persuasion begins before we even deliver our pitch or presentation. Through what he calls “ Pre-suasion ,” communicators can prime audiences to receive messages in a specific way, simply by drawing their attention in specific directions.

They typically exposed some internals via a front panel with lots of knobs and ports. Users would connect a terminal device (sometimes called a teletype or a TTY) to this front panel in order to input text and print the corresponding output.

I thought this would be a machine learning paper, you know deep learning and stuff. But this paper turned out to be a practical/applied data systems paper.

In short: JavaScript’s setTimeout breaks after ~25 days. I made setBigTimeout , a silly module to get around this problem. See the package on npm or the source code . setTimeout is JavaScript’s way of delaying code. You provide a timeout, in milliseconds, and a function to call after that time has elapsed. 1 setTimeout(() =&gt; { console.log( &#34;This runs after 2 seconds&#34; ); }, 2000 ); So far, so good. In most JavaScript runtimes, this duration is represented as a 32-bit signed integer.9 days...  ↩︎

I&#39;m solidly in favor of the Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) model of open source stewardship. This is how projects from Linux to Python, from Laravel to Ruby, and yes, Rails, have kept their cohesion, decisiveness, and forward motion. It&#39;s a model with decades worth of achievements to its name. But it&#39;s not a mandate from heaven. It&#39;s not infallible. Now I am loathe to even open this discussion. So what follows is not a categorical argument. His achievements are obvious. It&#39;s not too late.

Cell-based architecture has emerged as a response to many challenges associated with distributed systems. It employs the bulkhead pattern to isolate failures to a fraction of the affected infrastructure footprint and prevent widespread impact. Cells can also help organize large architectures into domain-bound deployment and delivery units, which provides essential sociotechnical benefits. By Erica Pisani, Rafal Gancarz

Netflix&#39;s EVCache system handles 400M ops/second across 22,000 servers, managing 14.3 PB of data. This infrastructure ensures global availability and resilience through intelligent data routing and flexible replication strategies. By implementing batch compression and switching to DNS-based discovery, Netflix optimizes efficiency, reduces bandwidth usage and significantly lowers operational costs.

Traditionally, methodologists are those who study research methods, both qualitative and quantitative.
