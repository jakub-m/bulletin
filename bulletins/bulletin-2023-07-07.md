## [Programming Language Perversity](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/programming-language-perversity/)


Harold Abelson once said that code should be written for humans to read and only incidentally for computers to write. It follows that, like any form of communication, code can carry emotions. Programming perversity, then, is code that conveys morbid fascination, the kind of amused horror where you cover your eyes but peek through your fingers. Take some innocuous features of a programming language and then bend it all into a pretzel. Congratulations, you&#39;ve made performance art. I miss it.

Author: Jason Kim In today’s highly competitive digital marketplace, understanding the true value of the advertising effort is no longer a luxury but a necessity. While there are many methodologies used to evaluate the effectiveness of advertisements, Instacart has a unique advantage. We can measure ad effectiveness, often termed ad incrementality, using Randomized Control Trials (RCTs), a method widely regarded as the “gold standard. This issue is mitigated through “Ghost Ad” simulation.

If you&#39;ve ever owned a domain name, the chances are good that at some point you&#39;ve received a snail mail letter which appears to be a bill for a domain or website-related services. In reality, these misleading missives try to trick people into paying for useless services they never ordered, don&#39;t need, and probably will never receive. Here&#39;s a look at the most recent incarnation of this scam -- DomainNetworks -- and some clues about who may be behind it.

Affirmative action is right up there with abortion and gun control among the highest-profile, longest-running social fissures in America. So of course the recent ruling from the Supreme Court making its use in college admissions illegal was going to light a political fire. The surprising thing is just how contained the burn has been within the tech industry. But perhaps it shouldn&#39;t be so surprising. Good. It really was a crazy time. But let&#39;s not forget that it isn&#39;t over everywhere yet.

Posted by Kuniaki Saito, Student Researcher, Google Research, Cloud AI Team, and Kihyuk Sohn, Research Scientist, Google Research Image retrieval plays a crucial role in search engines. Typically, their users rely on either image or text as a query to retrieve a desired target image. However, text-based retrieval has its limitations, as describing the target image accurately using words can be challenging.g., the color of a logo or the logo itself, is different from what they find in a website.

Although we have witnessed some transformative approaches to streamline application delivery, they have brought fundamental problems. Industry standards and approaches like DevOps and tools like Kubernetes have added to the complexity of shipping software faster. They can provision these resources on their own.

## [Building personal and organizational prestige](https://lethain.com/building-prestige/)


Most months I get at least one email from an engineering leader who believes they’d be a candidate for significantly more desirable roles if their personal brand were just better known. Similarly, when funding is readily available during periods of tech industry expansion, many companies believe they are principally constrained by their hiring velocity–if their engineering organization’s brand was just a bit better, they believe they’d be hiring much faster. Engineering brand versus.g.g.

## [Summary of reading: April - June 2023](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/summary-of-reading-april-june-2023/)


&#34;WebAssembly: The Definitive Guide&#34; by Brian Sletten - a wide and shallow overview of the WASM landscape. Logically, it can be seen as a compantion to &#34;The Art of WebAssembly&#34; which goes deep into the WASM language and spec; in reality, it falls short. The book is full of laborious explanations of computer basics, teaches basic C, basic Rust, etc. It&#39;s not clear if the book is meant for actual programmers or for non-technical folks getting the lay of the land. Not amazing, but not bad either.

The C&#43;&#43;11 standard introduced user-defined string suffixes. It also added regular  expressions to the C&#43;&#43; language as a standard feature. I wanted to have fun and see whether we could combine these features. Regular expressions are useful to check whether a given string matches a pattern. For example, the expression \d&#43; checks that the string … Continue reading Having fun with string literal suffixes in C&#43;&#43;

When I first worked with YAML config, it was a breath of fresh air. No more XML! No angle brackets. It was so plain and clear. But now, too often, when I see YAML, it’s a complex mess of nested lists hundreds of lines long. So where did things go wrong? To find out, let’s take a small problem, use YAML to make it more declarative, step by step, and see where the wheels fall off. In doing this, I think I can draw a clear line for when something should be config and when it shouldn’t.

Timing is key to many applications, but making things happen at the right time can be challenging. For instance, sometimes you need to introduce a delay to a script to make sure actions are taken precisely when you want them to. The good news is that the sleep command lets you do that. With it, you can pause your Linux scripts, ensuring everything happens when it should. It can also help when coordinating multiple services. The exact time to wait is specified as an argument to the command.
