It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve last rewritten my favorite lexical analyzer :-) That post is the last in a series implementing a lexer for the TableGen language in a variety of programming languages, using multiple techniques. The last lexer written, in Go, was very fast indeed - processing 1 MiB of source in about 20 milliseconds. The other day I started wondering whether Go compiler improvements from the last few years made this code run any faster. Back in 2014 I measured it with Go 1.18 is out.

Do any of those things, and feel joy in a job well done. A simple solution. Simplicity in a goal achieved. A perfect jewel, dirtied only by our clumsy hands.e.

Chatting with a friend recently, their company was running into a common developer productivity pitfall. The company had mandated a migration away from their monolithic architecture and mono repo, but the migration was stalling out. To speed up the transition, the responsible infrastructure team decided to stop supporting the monolith and instead focus on the new service environment. Engineers had started to resent the infrastructure team and their struggling migration.g.

Sometimes it pays to be a critic. Last year, I attempted to join the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) and Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). Both groups were trying to define a standard for identifying provenance: tracking ownership and changes to a picture, video, etc. I ended up not joining C2PA because of the restrictive membership terms. In contrast, it took over 6 months, but I did end up joining CAI . CAI is supposed to work in conjunction with C2PA.).

But why? I’ll get to that. First, storytime. In 2019, David Carney, David Crawshaw, and I started with a simple idea: that the majority of projects executed by the majority of software teams don’t need to scale. This poses a problem.

This one’s going to be a bit off topic. I have a long piece on the history of pattern matching I want to do but this week is really tight work-wise and this one’s less time-intensive to write. I’m very interested in “knacks”, or mental tricks that help out in day-to-day life. For example, being able to count quickly and having good memory palaces. Last year I thought I’d memorize a larger multiplication table. But some kids are taught the 12x12 table, so they just know that 8×12 = 96.4×8.7 = 12.

## [Warp: Lightweight Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/05/warp-lightweight-multi-key-transactions.html)


This paper introduces a simple yet powerful idea to provide efficient multi-key transactions with ACID semantics on top of a sharded NoSQL data store. The Warp protocol prevents serializability cycles forming between concurrent transactions by forcing them to serialize via a chain communication pattern rather than using a parallel 2PC fan-out/fan-in communication. I love the elegance of this idea. As far as I can see, this paper did not get published in any conference.

This paper (ICDE&#39;18) introduces Anna, a CALM / CRDT implementation of a distributed key-value system both at the data structure level as well as system architecture and transaction protocol levels. Anna is a partitioned, multi-mastered key-value system that achieves high performance and elasticity via wait-free execution and coordination-free consistency. Anna employs coordination-free actors that perform state update via merge of lattice-based composite data structures.e.e.

Google said this week it is expanding the types of data people can ask to have removed from search results, to include personal contact information like your phone number, email address or physical address. The move comes just months after Google rolled out a new policy enabling people under the age of 18 (or a parent/guardian) to request removal of their images from Google search results.

That is how I was able to run Lynx in my Lambda and build TextMode . So Lambda’s and containers combined seemed like a good solution, but node.js I’m less sure about.

GitOps starts with Git. You are probably already using Git to manage the source code of the microservices that make up your applications. Hopefully you also already use Git to manage the Kubernetes manifests that configure and deploy those microservices. Finally there is the additional dimension of environment e.g. development, staging and production. Source and Manifests The decision to have source code and manifests in the same or separate repositories is probably the most contentious.g.0.0.2.

## [From Kubernetes to PaaS - now what? (Ship It! #51)](https://changelog.com/shipit/51)


Today we talk to Mark Ericksen about all the things that we could be doing on the new platform - this is a follow-up to episode 50. Mark specialises in Elixir, he hosts the Thinking Elixir podcast, and he also helps make Fly.io the best place to run Phoenix apps, such as changelog.com. In the interest of holding our new platform right, we thought that it would be a great idea to talk to someone that does this all day, every day, for many years now.

This is somewhat far apart from my profession but I think having this kind of interest is healthy (get it?). Below are some books that I have enjoyed recently. Book covers compiled by the author. Eventually, I came to reach some parallels between my discipline and the medical sciences. Very software engineering-like, I know.g.

Setting up Service Level Objectives (SLOs) is one of the foundational tasks of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices, giving the SRE team a target against which to evaluate whether or not a service is running reliably enough. The inverse of your SLO is your error budget — how much unreliability you are willing to tolerate. In addition, it can help you identify which risks are the most important to prioritize and mitigate, using the best available data.  Starting with real outages is best.

Enterprises today have a very broad mix of networks — from SD-WANs, dedicated WANs such as MPLS, cloud interconnects, to VPNs. At the same time, they’re moving those WANs to the cloud to take advantage of faster turn-up, lower cost, and increased feature velocity. As workloads migrate to the cloud and multi-cloud environments, we believe that it’s critical to simplify enterprises’ networking model. Some use gateways, some use connections or links. Read Article
