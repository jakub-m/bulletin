You can now start projects in Linear when they are just an idea and centralize all of your project work in Linear through research, planning, and execution. Closing the gap between planning and building When planning a project, information often gets scattered across multiple platforms like docs, Slack channels, Figma files, and spreadsheets. Our new project design closes the gap between planning and execution.

Some might point to the character of discourse on the mailing list , others to the shortage of patch reviewers, and others still to the difficulty of getting the attention of a committer, or of feeling like a hostage to some committer&#39;s whimsy.

In 1979, Intel introduced the 8088 microprocessor, a variant of the 16-bit 8086 processor. IBM&#39;s decision to use the 8088 processor in the IBM PC (1981) was a critical point in computer history, leading to the success of the x86 architecture. The designers of the IBM PC selected the 8088 for multiple reasons, but a key factor was that the 8088 processor&#39;s 8-bit bus was similar to the bus of the 8085 processor.&#34; A typical 8088 bus cycle consists of four T-states, with one T-state per clock cycle.

Growing up, I watched a sitcom called Dad’s Army, which revolved around a troop of Home Guard soldiers during the Second World War. One of the characters, Lance Corporal Jones, had a catchphrase, “Don’t panic! Don’t panic.” While at the same time doing just that, panicking. It was hilarious and left its mark on me by demonstrating that panicking is the last thing you should do when faced with a challenge. Then, rushing around, panicking about how you will get everything done before the day ends.

About two-thirds of Digg’s team left in layoffs in 2010, but we found ways to amble on. Once you start factoring in holding specific relationships, e.g.g.

On the contrary, hardware designers work very hard to make sure computers run every program the same way every time. So when a program does need random numbers, that requires extra effort. Traditionally, computer scientists and programming languages have distinguished between two different kinds of random numbers: statistical and cryptographic randomness.

There&#39;s an interesting psychological phenomenon where programmers tend to ascribe more trust to computers run by anyone but themselves. Perhaps it&#39;s a corollary to imposter syndrome, which leads programmers to believe that if a computer is operated by AWS or SaaS or literally anyone else, it must be more secure, better managed, less buggy, and ultimately purer. I wish that was so, but there are no magic machines and no magic operators. Just the same kind of potentially faulty bits and brains.

So we&#39;re going to drop the remote runners and just bring continuous integration back to developer machines at 37signals. HEY is a pretty substantial code base too.

One important design principle in software development is DRY – Don’t Repeat Yourself.

Here at Grafana Labs, we have a long-standing commitment to helping our users understand how their applications and services behave from an external point of view. This critical practice — known as synthetic monitoring — has been a key focus of ours for nearly a decade.  Back in 2015, we released worldPing, our first product to help measure the user experience and improve website performance.

In 2017, we open sourced Grafana k6 and made its first beta available to everyone. This wasn’t our first rodeo — k6 marked the third load testing tool our team had developed over a decade. We had recognized the gaps in existing solutions, as well as the barriers that were hindering adoption in the developer community. The plan was simple yet ambitious: let’s build a tool developers actually enjoy using and that helps engineering teams build more reliable software. Start simple and then iterate..

Eliminating carbon pollution from aviation is one of the most challenging parts of the climate puzzle, simply because large commercial airlines are too heavy and need too much power during takeoff for today’s batteries to do the job.  But one way that companies and governments are striving to make some progress is through the use…

In 1912, Oskar von Miller , an electrical engineer and founder of the Deutsches Museum , had an idea: Could you project an artificial starry sky onto a dome, as a way of demonstrating astronomical principles to the public? It was such a novel concept that when von Miller approached the Carl Zeiss company in Jena, Germany, to manufacture such a projector, they initially rebuffed him. The projector that Zeiss planned for the Deutsches Museum would be far more elaborate.

One of the biggest challenges for robotics right now is practical autonomous operation in unstructured environments. That is, doing useful stuff in places your robot hasn’t been before and where things may not be as familiar as your robot might like. Robots thrive on predictability, which has put some irksome restrictions on where and how they can be successfully deployed. And the currently ongoing DARPA RACER program tasks autonomous vehicles with navigating long distances off-road.

While the former is key to keeping the traditional part of Moore’s Law going, the latter could accelerate a trend toward processors made from more and more silicon, leading quickly to systems the size of a full silicon wafer. Such a system, Tesla’s next generation Dojo training tile is already in production, TSMC says.
