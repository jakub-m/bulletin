As a part of a broader initiative of refreshing Allegro platform, we are upgrading our internal libraries to Spring Boot 3.0 and Java 17. The task is daunting and filled with challenges, however overall progress is steady and thanks to the modular nature of our code it should end in finite time. Everyone who has performed such an upgrade knows that you need to expect the unexpected and at the end of the day prepare for lots of debugging.gradle files and reference them in dependencies by key.3.0.

## [Hand-written Windows API prototypes: fast, flexible, and tedious](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/05/31/)


I love fast builds, and for years I’ve been bothered by the build penalty for translation units including windows.h . This header has an enormous number of definitions and declarations and so, for C programs, it tends to dominate the build time of those translation units. Most programs, especially systems software, only needs a tiny portion of it. For example, when compiling u-config with GCC, two thirds of the debug build was spent processing windows.c , which does nothing but include windows.

I define executive presence as a set of behaviors that will influence others to fully listen to what you say . You can be right all the time, and the hardest worker at the company, but to be maximally effective people need to judge your ideas on their own merits. One sign of the lack of executive presence is being defined by your vocation. Others freeze.g.

I&#39;m doing more traveling these days and I&#39;ve finally decided that I need something to track my luggage and laptop bag. There are a couple of different options (Tile, Samsung Smart Tag, Apple AirTag, etc.). I went with the AirTag because it has the widest support. (Anyone with an Apple iPhone will help you track the AirTag, and Apple devices comprise about 52% of the US market .) Making a Case Physically, Apple&#39;s AirTag is a coin-shaped disc that is little larger than a bottle cap.apple.findmy.

## [Trust your users — they’re usually right](https://sookocheff.com/post/opinion/trust-your-users/)


I was recently introduced to a simple article on system design: Users are almost always right. In it, a simple rule is stated: When the users keep doing it wrong, the users are right and your system is wrong. This rule reminded me of the concept of desire paths: unplanned trails created by human or animal traffic that usually represent the shortest or easiest route between two places.

It even gained a considerable number of users after I published my article. A reader tipped me off however that the Zoom Plus extension also makes a request to serasearchtop[.]com. I checked it out and found two other versions of the same malicious code. User counts reflect the state for 2023-05-30.polyfill .

By Jose Fernandez , Ed Barker , Hank Jacobs Introduction In November 2022, we introduced a brand new tier —  Basic with ads . This tier extended existing infrastructure by adding new backend components and a new remote call to our ads partner on the playback path. As we were gearing up for launch, we wanted to ensure it would go as smoothly as possible. We used this simulation to help us surface problems of scale and validate our Ads algorithms. Fig. Fig. Keep an eye out for updates on this.

We would look at every decision, every trendy buzzword, and every fancy technology through the lens of cognitive load. The threshold at which it&#39;s worth switching to indexing, though, might be higher than you&#39;d guess. Or look for the research papers and sources that fueled the change.

As I’ve served longer in an executive role, I’ve started to notice recurring communication challenges between executives and the folks they work with. The most frequent issue I see is when a literal communicator insists on engaging in the details with a less literal executive. I call the remedy, “extracting the kernel. Instead, their point is that the timeline feels too slow. If the team anchors on responding to the specific suggestion, they’ll miss the more important discussion entirely.

Both of these qualities make stolen or ill-gotten code-signing certificates attractive to cybercriminal groups, who prize their ability to add stealth and longevity to malicious software.

It improves bit by bit, one little step at a time — editing, running unit tests, fixing build errors, addressing code reviews, editing some more, appeasing linters , and fixing more errors — until finally it becomes good enough to merge into a code repository. DIDACT is a multi-task model trained on development activities that include editing, debugging, repair, and code review.

The world is full of talented, capable people who&#39;d rather put their own efforts to direct use than manage others. But the natural inclination is to promote senior contributors up a managerial ladder, and out of the trenches. This often ends poorly, turning the promotion into a punishment. It&#39;s usually not that these potential managers don&#39;t like working with others. Quite the contrary. It&#39;s also usually not that they&#39;re uncomfortable being senior, in terms of setting a direction for the work.

In all the years we ran 360 performance reviews – the employee assessment process where you solicit feedback from peers, reports, and manager – I can think of only once when it lead to a meaningful follow-up. The rest of the time, across hundreds of reviews, it was an arduous, awkward affair of forcing people to come up with novel ways to congratulate each other on command.

There&#39;s just a special kind of magic that comes from being together, which Zoom will never match or catch.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular programming paradigm used in many modern programming languages, including Python. At the core of OOP are classes that allow us to create objects with attributes and methods. However, regular classes in Python have limitations that can make it challenging to create modular and maintainable code. Additionally, regular classes cannot be used for type checking at runtime, which can lead to errors in code. # shape. # shape.length = length self . my_car.
