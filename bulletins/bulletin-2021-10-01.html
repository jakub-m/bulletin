                        I had been hearing a lot of negative comments about Fountainhead on Twitter. These comments seemed politically motivated, how the book is a dumb libertarian propaganda. I had to check the book out myself to see what the deal is.  The book started out well. I was surprised to see that, first this is a novel, and second this is an easy read. I was waiting an impenetrable intellectual literary text. The book turned out to readable and initially charming, even though it was written in 1940...

                        I’m preparing my talk for the TLA&#43; Conference this week. I asked around about intermediate stuff people wanted me to cover and there was a lot of interest in model optimization. The TLA&#43; model checker, TLC, brute forces every possible reachable state. If there are lots of possible states then it’ll take a very long time to run. The fundamental skill of optimization is being able to estimate how many states there are and how many states a safe change will eliminate.031% of the elements.030%. 3 .

                        Due to recent changes in Windows Update, upgrading the operating system on a Windows 10 or Windows 11 machine running Tailscale may break Tailscale connectivity.

To avoid this issue, upgrade Tailscale on your Windows machines to Tailscale 1.14.4 or later before running Windows Update .

I would hear people mention Awk and how often they used it, and I was pretty certain I was missing out on some minor superpower. Like this little off hand comment by Bryan Cantrill : I write three or four Awk programs a day. And these are one-liners. These super quick programs. It turns out Awk is pretty simple.com.

Packaging has always been an important step in media processing. After content ingestion, inspection and encoding, the packaging step encapsulates encoded video and audio in codec agnostic container formats and provides features such as audio video synchronization, random access and DRM protection.g.

But accessing numerous computing resources distributed across the globe via a single endpoint presents a latency challenge. Today we are announcing that the hosted edition of Teleport Access Plane is now available in 5 regions all over the world.

                        Those of us that work with technology get this question a lot: “What do you do?” “I work in technology — more specifically, I work as a pre-sales engineer.” [blank stare] Sound familiar? Working in IT can mean a lot of different things, and to those outside of this world, it quickly becomes deeply technical and complicated to explain to non-IT people. Even explaining what you do to IT people can become complicated.

Oftentimes developers are only concerned about testing the application layer of the system (a.k.a the codebase) and ignore testing the data layer (the database) which is also as important as testing the code itself. These may include validating the schema, testing CRUD operations and transactions to ensure that the database is properly set up to serve the application.

One ongoing debate is the choice between two different programming paradigms called functional programming and object-oriented programming . You could argue that it depends. In this article, we will look at both choices and try to distill myth from fact. Values like numbers are considered immutable.

                        In this episode, we will be exploring the tiny world of Go and Hardware. We are joined by three gophers, Vladimir Vivien, Tobias Theel, and Ron Evans, who will be discussing the use of Linux API (V4L2) to control video hardware and capture image data in realtime, programming Bluetooth devices, working on WiFi communication using an Arduino Nano 33 IoT NINA chip, and much more.

                        Things go wrong all the time. We all make mistakes. And that is okay. What is not okay, is to think that it won’t happen, or that there will be someone else around when it does. In that moment, it doesn’t matter who wrote that module, package or microservice. But there is a better way to think about this, and there is an approach that makes people actually look forward to incidents. In this episode, Gerhard is joined by Stephen Whitworth and Chris Evans, incident.

In this week’s fully connected episode, Chris and Daniel use this framework to help them discuss how an organization can strike a good balance between human intelligence and AI. AI can’t solve everything and humans need to be in-the-loop with many AI solutions.

By the way, these are publicly available in our #incidents Slack channel. Episode 3 show notes include a YouTube stream which captures it all.

                        By Prakash Hariramani, Sr Director, Product, Coinbase Over the next few weeks, we’re rolling out the ability for customers in the US to deposit their paycheck into Coinbase to more easily make regular crypto trades, spend on Coinbase Card, earn crypto rewards¹, and more. Get paid in crypto² or in US dollars and deposit as much³ or as little of your paycheck as you want. The future of payroll is coming. However, customers tell us that making frequent transfers is time-consuming and inconvenient.

Starting today, when we launch new assets on the Coinbase Exchange we will be using a price auction to help price discovery and create a healthier market when trading starts. How price auctions work In our price auctions, limit orders are collected over a minimum of 10 minutes for price discovery. These auctions can be canceled without matching any orders.

                        Today on the Day Two Cloud podcast we have a sponsored show with Akamai and a customer, IBM Cloud. When IBM rebuilt its Cloud Console from a monolithic application to microservices, the company turned to Akamai to help improve application performance while also supporting routing, failover, and availability across six global data centers. We get details from Pavel Despot, Sr. Product Marketing Manager at Akamai; and Tony Erwin, Senior Technical Staff Member/Architect at IBM.

                        For security, it is a best practice to limit the number of public IP addresses in your network. In Google Cloud, Cloud NAT ( network address translation ) lets certain resources without external IP addresses create outbound connections to the internet. This proxyless architecture means higher scalability (no single choke point) and lower latency. It also provides destination network address translation (DNAT) for established inbound response packets only.240.0.0/16.168.1.0/24. Read Article

                        Who would have known that today technology would enable us with the ability to use machine learning to track vessel activity, and make pattern inferences to help address IUU (illegal, unreported, and unregulated) fishing activities. What’s even more noteworthy is that we now have the computing power to share this information publicly in order to enable fair and sustainable use of our ocean.

                        In this blog series, a companion to our paper , we’re exploring different types of data-driven organizations. In the last blog , we discussed main principles for building a data engineering driven organisation. In this second part of the series focus is on how to build a data science driven organization. In order to create a sustainable competitive advantage from this paradigmatic shift companies need to become ‘data science driven organizations’.e. Visit our Vertex AI page to learn more. 1. 2.

                        You might be thinking, “Wait, Google Cloud Next is in October this year?” and “Wait, it’s already October?” Well, if the past year has taught us anything, it’s that odd schedules and wearing sweats to work are the new norm - all belts bets are off. So get ready because #GoogleCloudNext is coming up from Oct 12-14th on a virtual screen near you (yes, you can keep your sweats on!). We’ll start each morning with a live, must-see broadcast and keynote. Don’t miss this session to hear from the Sr.

                        Stuck at home these past–checks calendar–732 months, I&#39;ve been spending a lot more time on Discord (an online voice, video and text communications service) than I ever thought I would. Chatting with far-flung friends, playing games, exploring, finding community as I am able, and generally learning about a platform I had not used all that much before the pandemic.  So I wondered: could I make one?  Since bots are just code that interact with Discord&#39;s APIs, they have to have a computer to run on.
