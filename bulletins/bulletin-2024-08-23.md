I was recently commissioned by a company to make a bespoke TLA&#43; workshop with a strong emphasis on reading specifications. I normally emphasize writing specs, so this one will need a different approach. While working on it, I had an idea that might make teaching TLA&#43;— and other formal methods — a little easier. Pseudospecs There are two problems to reading a spec: Learning the mental model of what TLA&#43; is actually doing Learning how to actually read TLA&#43;.) Couple things to notice...

## [Migrating Mess With DNS to use PowerDNS](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/08/19/migrating-mess-with-dns-to-use-powerdns/)


About 3 years ago, I announced Mess With DNS in this blog post , a playground where you can learn how DNS works by messing around and creating records. I wasn’t very careful with the DNS implementation though (to quote the release blog post: “following the DNS RFCs? not exactly”), and people started reporting problems that eventually I decided that I wanted to fix. There were a couple of challenges I ran into when setting up PowerDNS that I’ll talk about here.example.example.example.example...2.

Bugs in distributed systems are hard to find, largely because systems interact in chaotic ways. And even once you&#39;ve found a bug, it can be anywhere from simple to impossible to reproduce it. It&#39;s about as far away as you can get from the ideal test environment: property testing a pure function. It&#39;s called Deterministic Simulation Testing (DST). It has become so popular to talk about DST in my corner of the world that I worry it risks coming off sounding too magical and maybe a little hyped.

## [Software estimates have never worked and never will](https://world.hey.com/dhh/software-estimates-have-never-worked-and-never-will-a41a9c71)


Since the dawn of computing, humans have sought to estimate how long it takes to build software, and for just as long, they&#39;ve consistently failed. Estimating even medium-sized projects is devilishly difficult, and estimating large projects is virtually impossible. Yet the industry keeps insisting that the method that hasn&#39;t worked for sixty years will definitely work on this next project, if we all just try a little harder. It&#39;s the definition of delusional. It&#39;s time to accept this.

I used to find the American self-image of being this uniquely freedom-loving, freedom-having people delusional. Sure, I&#39;d think, you&#39;re not North Korea or Venezuela, but is that really a standard worth celebration? Shouldn&#39;t America compare itself to higher alternatives, like Europe or even the rest of the Anglosphere? Turns out I just needed to wait a little longer for the patriotic hymns to begin ringing true. Witness what&#39;s going on in both the UK and the EU at the moment.S.A.

## [How To Simplify Your To-do List.](https://www.carlpullein.com/blog/how-to-simplify-your-to-do-list/22/8/2024)


You can improve your task management by breaking down tasks into groups. One problem many people face is task overload. When you look at your list of tasks for the day and see forty to eighty tasks, your energy sinks, you wonder how you will get those tasks done and where you should start. When I work with people with this kind of issue, I notice they have six or seven tasks related to calling people: “Call Jen about the off-site meeting,” “Follow up with Pete,” etc.

One problem you will face if you measure your productivity by the number of tasks you do is that you will be disappointed and frustrated. You’re prone to differing energy levels and emotions. This means that even with the most enthusiasm, there will be days when you don’t feel like doing much work. Instead, consider setting a few non-negotiables. These are the tasks you commit to, regardless of your energy levels, giving you a sense of control and reassurance. And that’s fine. Job done.

In 1993, I was introduced to the Franklin Planner system . This beautiful leather-bound time management system contained everything needed to run your day on two pages. What made the Franklin Planner system so practical was its layout: a to-do list on the right, a daily calendar next to it, and a space for notes. It was all there, neatly organised and ready to use. Yet, I didn’t really learn to use it properly until I was sent on a course. It was just a very expensive to-do list and diary.

This is Chapter 3, part 1 for the Designing Data Intensive Applications (DDIA) book.  This part focuses on storage and retrieval for OLTP databases. Even if you won&#39;t be implementing a storage engine from scratch, it is still important to understand how databases handle storage and retrieval internally. This knowledge allows you to select and tune a storage engine that best fits your application&#39;s needs. There are two main families of storage engines: log-structured storage engines (e.g.g.g.

Daddy, how did the cofounders fall into these tarpits? Well, son, it was a long long a time ago— How long? Millions of years ago? No, not that long ago. I see ML engineers, so maybe 2023 or early 2024, during the early LLM epoch. Feels like years, doesn&#39;t it? I remember— But why do the cofounders risk it? Can&#39;t they see it&#39;s dangerous? They ignore the risks because all the VCs are in there. Well, why do the VCs go in there? Great question! It&#39;s because the founders are there. I don&#39;t know.

Your favorite podcast on all things observability is officially back and better than ever. Today, we’re excited to kick off season 2 of “Grafana’s Big Tent,” our award-winning podcast about the people, community, technology, and tools shaping observability. We launched “Grafana’s Big Tent” in 2022 , with the goal of engaging in fun, thoughtful, and open conversations with members of the observability community.

When you hear about Adaptive Metrics in Grafana Cloud, all signs point to how it’s a game changer. Adaptive Metrics , which aggregates unused and partially used metrics into lower cardinality versions, has delivered a 35% reduction in metrics costs on average for more than 1,200 organizations . Companies have also spoken candidly about the cost savings they gained from the feature. And yet, you’re still hesitant about implementing automated aggregations and possibly losing critical data.

There were early signs that Muhammad Hamza Ihtisham was born to excel in engineering or computer science, but family tradition initially steered him toward a career in medicine. Ihtisham’s mother and other family members were medical professionals. His father is a businessman. Even though his father had dreamed of having a son in the engineering field, it was assumed that Ihtisham would become a doctor. And he almost did. He has never looked back. “That was a turning point for me,” he says.”

In our goal of trying to estimate a programming language’s popularity, we realized that no one can look over the shoulder of every person writing code, whether that be a child writing a Java script for a personal Minecraft server, a mobile app developer hoping to hit it big, or an aerospace engineer writing mission-critical code for a voyage to Mars. Our Top Programming Languages interactive tries to tackle the problem of estimating a language’s popularity by looking for proxy signals.S.K.

Welcome to IEEE Spectrum ’s 11th annual rankings of the most popular programming languages. As always, we combine multiple metrics from different sources to create three meta rankings. The “Spectrum” ranking is weighted towards the profile of the typical IEEE member, the “Trending” ranking seeks to spot languages that are in the zeitgeist, and the “Jobs” ranking measures what employers are looking for. You can find a full breakdown of our methodology here , but let’s jump into our results.

Back in June 2022, Oak Ridge National Laboratory debuted Frontier —the world’s most powerful supercomputer . Frontier can perform a billion billion calculations per second. And yet there are computational problems that Frontier may never be able to solve in a reasonable amount of time. Some of these problems are as simple as factoring a large number into primes . However, in the next decade, we expect a new form of supercomputing to emerge unlike anything prior. A quantum computer also has bits.

IEEE Collabratec has made it easier for volunteers to display their IEEE positions. The online networking platform released a new benefit this year for its users: digital certificates for IEEE volunteering. They reflect contributions made to the organization, such as leading a committee or organizing an event. Members can download the certificates and add them to their LinkedIn profile or résumé. Volunteers also can print their certificates to frame and display in their office.

Stop for a second and think about the Internet without digital images or video. There would be no faces on Facebook . Instagram and TikTok probably wouldn’t exist. Those Zoom meetings that took the place of in-person gatherings for school or work during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic? Not an option. Digital audio’s place in our Internet-connected world is just as important as still images and video. “Only a few image-compression standards not using DCT exist today,” he adds.Y.D.D.S.

A maze of brackish and freshwater ponds covers Taiwan’s coastal plain, supporting aquaculture operations that produce roughly NT $30 billion (US $920 million) worth of seafood every year. Taiwan’s government is hoping that the more than 400 square kilometers of fishponds can simultaneously produce a second harvest: solar power. What is aquavoltaics? That’s the impetus behind the new 42.9-megawatt aquavoltaics facility in the southern city of Tainan. The fishponds are hard to ignore. 4.
