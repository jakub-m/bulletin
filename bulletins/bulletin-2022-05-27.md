I’ve been in a handful of discussions over the past few weeks about plagiarization: how should authors approach their work being directly or indirectly copied? When I started writing online in 2007, I was writing to learn to write, and my early stuff showed that, by which I mean it wasn’t very good. As I moved towards management, I was particularly inspired by Michael Lopp’s blog , who was, for me, a rare and thoughtful writer on engineering management. Rewrites come in many forms.

These are a bluff of course, but the popular Screencastify browser extension actually provides all the infrastructure necessary for someone to pull this off. A website that a user visited could trick the extension into starting a webcam recording among other things, without any indications other than the webcam’s LED lighting up if present.70.0. .g.69.0.

Many recent Intel processors benefit from a new family of instructions called AVX-512. These instructions operate over wide registers (up to 512 bits) and follow the Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) paradigm. These new AVX-512 instructions allow you to break some speed records, such as decoding base64 data at the speed of a memory copy. Most … Continue reading Parsing JSON faster with Intel AVX-512

The rise of data-intensive “Web 2.0” Internet services has led to popular new Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) programming frameworks. Rather than adopting the use of traditional transactional programming primitives, the ORM framework developers use feral (application-level) mechanisms for maintaining database integrity. They specify declarative correctness criteria/invariants (through validations and associations) and have the ORM enforce the criteria on their behalf. No, Mr...01 locks, 1.e.

At Netflix, we want to entertain the world through creating engaging content and helping members discover the titles they will love. Key to that is understanding causal effects that connect changes we make in the product to indicators of member joy. To measure causal effects we rely heavily on AB testing , but we also leverage quasi-experimentation in cases where AB testing is limited. Many scientists across Netflix have contributed to the way that Netflix analyzes these causal effects.

Intro Since I work with JavaScript, I have often found myself in a position where I was discussing with my colleagues if we should use null or undefined. I’ve spent a lot of my time explaining my point of view and justifying my choices but as always in JS there are many aspects to consider and many ways to achieve the result. It’s noteworthy that both null and undefined could work in your project if you are using them in a smart way. Let’s consider some examples here. Let’s look into that.

For instance, you — like others who are learning about Docker — may wonder how a Docker image differs from a Docker container. Their contrasts are subtle but significant.

Kubernetes networking enables the components that make up the Kubernetes ecosystem, like containers, pods, and services, to communicate effectively with each other. As a result, networking permeates Kubernetes. Because Kubernetes is primarily a distributed system, it relies on networks to operate effectively. Therefore, a guide discussing Kubernetes networking is an invaluable resource to anyone interested in Kubernetes. Kubernetes also provides various types of container networking solutions .

There are many reasons engineers look to Kubernetes when running their workloads, like support for containers and orchestration. Another major reason for choosing Kubernetes, though, is being able to automatically scale the services found within a cluster. Configuring and using autoscaling within your cluster is a great way to make sure that the nodes within your cluster are using the optimal amount of resources, as running at a hundred percent isn’t advisable. One of these tools is Lens .

When you start learning about Kubernetes, you quickly learn about the key components that you need in order to run your applications, such as pods, deployments, and persistent volumes, but the components that aren’t absolute necessities often come a little later in your learning journey. One of these components is namespaces, which helps you isolate workloads. This comes in handy when you have several different projects under the same cluster. This is why you want isolation.

The typical smart factory is said to produce around 5 petabytes of data per week . That’s equivalent to 5 million gigabytes, or roughly 20,000 smartphones. Managing such vast amounts of data in one facility, let alone a global organization, would be challenging enough. Doing so on the factory floor, in near-real-time, to drive insights, enhancements, and particularly safety, is a big dream for leading manufacturers. This is the new world of edge computing.

## [Monitoring transaction ID utilization using Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL metrics](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/monitor-transaction-id-utilization-in-cloud-sql-postgresql/)


PostgreSQL uses transaction IDs (also called TXIDs or XIDs) to implement Multi-Version Concurrency Control semantics (MVCC). The PostgreSQL documentation explains the role of XIDs as follows: PostgreSQL&#39;s MVCC transaction semantics depend on being able to compare transaction ID (XID) numbers: a row version with an insertion XID greater than the current transaction&#39;s XID is “in the future” and should not be visible to the current transaction. In short, catastrophic data loss. (.....).g.g.0 to 1.
