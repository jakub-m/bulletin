It’s About Time! What&#39;s the time? Time to get a watch. MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [[&#39;$&#39;, &#39;$&#39;], [&#39;\\(&#39;, &#39;\\)&#39;]]} }; My friend Al Vermeulen used to say time is for the amusement of humans 1 .

## [Managing Slack Connect](https://slack.engineering/managing-slack-connect/)


Slack Connect, AKA shared channels, allows communication between different Slack workspaces, via channels shared by participating organizations. Slack Connect has existed for a few years now, and the sheer volume of channels and external connections has increased significantly since the launch.

Processors are driven by a clock, which controls the timing of each step inside the chip. In this blog post, I&#39;ll examine the clock-generation circuitry inside the Intel 386 processor. Earlier processors such as the 8086 (1978) were simpler, using two clock phases internally. The Intel 386 processor (1985) was a pivotal development for Intel as it moved x86 to CMOS (as well as being the first 32-bit x86 processor). The 386&#39;s CMOS circuitry required four clock signals. From the 8080 datasheet .e.

Pressure on complex systems can create many small, seemingly un-correlated issues that on the surface seem unrelated to their shared root cause: Falling stock prices create frustration that manifests as dissatisfaction in things like benefits and career growth. A new leader is introduced and their team seems to have all sorts of problems, like anger with collaboration across teams and frustration with company processes and burnout. This concept is powerful and not uncommon.

B-tree is a structure that helps to search through great amounts of data. It was invented over 40 years ago, yet it is still employed by the majority of modern databases. Although there are newer index structures, like LSM trees, B-tree is unbeaten when handling most of the database queries. After reading this post, you will know how B-tree organises the data and how it performs search queries. Origins In order to understand B-tree let’s focus on Binary Search Tree (BST) first.org , Edward M.g.

When KrebsOnSecurity broke the news on Oct. 20, 2023 that identity and authentication giant Okta had suffered a breach in its customer support department, Okta said the intrusion allowed hackers to steal sensitive data from fewer than one percent of its 18,000&#43; customers. But today, Okta revised that impact statement, saying the attackers also stole the name and email address for nearly all of its customer support users.

Suppose that you want to parse quickly 8-bit integers (0, 1, 2, …, 254, 255) from an ASCII/UTF-8 string. The problem comes up in the simdzone project lead by Jeroen Koekkoek (NLnet Labs).

Modern web applications often use the http/https protocols. However, when the server and client needs to talk to each other in a symmetrical fashion, the WebSocket protocol might be preferable. For example, if you want to program a multiplayer video game, the WebSocket protocol is almost surely better than http.

Conventional web applications use the http protocol (or the https variant). The http protocol is essentially asymmetrical: a client application such as a browser issues requests and the server responds. It is not possible for the server to initiate communication with the client. Certain types of applications are therefore more difficult to design.

Recently I have talked to a handful of fellow students and scholars who had research interests which involved the analysis of free-form text. Unfortunately to everyone, gaining meaningful insight to written natural language is not a trivial task by any measures. Close reading is of course an option, but you would ideally prefer to look at textual data through a more macro-analytical/quantitative lens as well. Not to mention that in the age of big data close reading is rarely a feasible option.

To make memorable art, compress arguments/emotions into potent vehicles. Here&#39;s my general algorithm for making things: vibes: A brilliant idea strikes, so I feverishly record some lurking feeling or suspicion as a cryptic note. arguments: I split/organize the note into core theses or emotions I want to evoke. The main goal is to connect two unrelated ideas into a &#34;eureka!&#34; experience. When I&#39;m feeling fancy, I sprinkle some modus ponens on top. Any clown car will do.

## [Measure twice, vise thrice.](https://taylor.town/vises)


Makers, always mind your degrees-of-freedom . Nobody can do their best work on wobbly projects. Vises reduce movement in undesirable directions. They help you focus your energy in limited axes. Good measurements are wasted on uneven cuts, and vice versa. Consider woodworking. This &#34;clamping/cutting&#34; philosophy translates to other domains. For example, drawing has many specialized tools to guide pen/pencil movement, like clipboards , mirrors , french curves , and rulers .

## [Build Your Own Hi-fi Ear Defenders](https://spectrum.ieee.org/hi-fi-ear-defenders)


Many of us have gotten used to being able to dampen unwanted sound, thanks to the noise-cancellation technology found in, for example, Apple’s AirPods Pro earbuds . But this tech gets you only so far: Noise cancellation works just for relatively low frequencies, and the overall hearing protection that earbuds can offer is also relatively limited. Earplugs or over-the-ear defenders are an option, but they block wanted as well as unwanted sounds. Of course, easier said than done.

## [Volunteer Training Program Sees Record Growth As it Marks 10 Years](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-volt-marks-10-years)


IEEE depends on volunteer members for many things, including organizing conferences, coordinating regional and local activities, writing standards, and deciding on IEEE’s future. But because the organization can be complex, many members don’t know what resources and roles are available to them, and they might need training on how to lead groups. That’s why in 2013, the IEEE Member and Geographic Activities board established its Volunteer Leadership Program .tv .

## [Generating Power on Earth From the Coldness of Deep Space](https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy-from-cold)


It’s a summer night. On the rooftop of a quiet building, a set of panels cools the rooms within and keeps the lights on, removing heat and generating electricity using the coldness of the sky. That cold isn’t in the air around the building—the night is warm. Rather, the panels reach far beyond Earth’s atmosphere to tap the distant cold of deep space. Sound crazy? Admittedly, this technology isn’t fully available just yet. That was pretty cool—literally. Glass is a great material for an emitter.

## [Sustainability starts with the data center](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/30/1083909/sustainability-starts-with-the-data-center/)


When asked why he targeted banks, notorious criminal Willie Sutton reportedly answered, “Because that’s where the money is.” Similarly, when thoughtful organizations target sustainability, they look to their data centers—because that’s where the carbon emissions are. The International Energy Agency (IEA) attributes about 1.5% of total global electricity use to data centers and data transmission…

In the fall of 2018, the University of California (UC) tasked a team of researchers with identifying tree planting or similar projects from which it could confidently purchase carbon offsets that would reliably cancel out greenhouse gas emissions across its campuses.  The researchers found next to nothing. “We took a look across the whole market…
