## [DNS Evolution](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-07/truncation.html)


The choice of UDP as the default transport for the DNS was not a completely unqualified success. On the positive side, the stateless query/response model of UDP has been a good fit to the stateless query/response model of DNS transactions between a client and a server. Perhaps most importantly, the way UDP handles large payloads is a problem.

By Scott Arciszewski Today, AES-GCM is one of two cipher modes used by TLS 1.3 (the other being ChaCha20-Poly1305) and the preferred method for encrypting data in FIPS-validated modules. But despite its overwhelming success, AES-GCM has been the root cause of some catastrophic failures: for example, Hanno Böck and Sean Devlin exploited nonce misuse to […]

This was a last-minute abstract submission to UNSOUND 2024 . As networked programs change, the communication between sound programs inevitably becomes unsound. Surprisingly, there exist no practical means of maintaining contracts between networked programs. Software developers suffer accordingly: the &#34;/v2&#34; problem: REST server maintainers rely on a fragile honor system to publish API changes. As a result, many APIs permanently embed &#34;/v1&#34; and &#34;/v2&#34; in their URLs while pushing breaking changes.g.

It now seems laughable that only a few months ago, I was questioning whether I&#39;d actually be able to switch off the Apple stack and stick to my choice. That&#39;s what two decades worth of entrenched habits will do to your belief in change! But not only was it possible, it&#39;s been immensely enjoyable. What seemed so difficult at first now appears trivial, since it&#39;s been done. That&#39;s not a critique of the Apple ecosystem per se. Apple continues to make great hardware and pretty good software too.

In today&#39;s fast-paced work environment, using real-time collaboration tools like Google Docs and Figma comes naturally to most of us. As a result, we&#39;ve come to expect a lot more from our tools. Yet, when it comes to building software, we often find ourselves stuck with tools built for a different era — tools that cause our teams to feel siloed, inefficient, and less collaborative overall. Today, however, the process is much more fluid and cross-functional.

At least a dozen organizations with domain names at domain registrar Squarespace saw their websites hijacked last week. Squarespace bought all assets of Google Domains a year ago, but many customers still haven&#39;t set up their new accounts. Experts say malicious hackers learned they could commandeer any migrated Squarespace accounts that hadn&#39;t yet been registered, merely by supplying an email address tied to an existing domain.

In the fast-paced world of technology, change is constant — and nowhere is that more evident today than in the flood of new features and advancements involving large language models (LLMs). They power various applications, from chat bots to advanced copilots. And as these LLMs and applications become more sophisticated, it will be vital that they work well and reliably. This is where observability, with the help of OpenTelemetry (using OpenLIT ), plays an essential role.g., GPT-3.5).g. 1.

## [Spilling the git tea (Ship It! #112)](https://changelog.com/shipit/112)


Git was designed to be distributed but there is a lot of gravity around GitHub. What does the model look like for a business that encourages you to run your own git server and what does the backend for gitea.com look like?

## [IEEE Learning Network Celebrates Five Years](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-learning-network-anniversary)


Since its launch in 2019, the IEEE Learning Network (ILN) has been instrumental in advancing professional development through its diverse array of courses and programs. From specialized technical training to broader skill development, ILN online courses cater to professionals at every stage of their career and equip them with tools they need to succeed in today’s rapidly evolving landscape. ILN is also achieving its original goal of becoming a one stop shop for education from across IEEE.

## [Robot Dog Cleans Up Beaches With Foot-Mounted Vacuums](https://spectrum.ieee.org/robot-dog-vacuum)


Cigarette butts are the second most common undisposed-of litter on Earth—of the six trillion-ish cigarettes inhaled every year, it’s estimated that over 4 trillion of the butts are just tossed onto the ground, each one leeching over 700 different toxic chemicals into the environment. Ew. Preventing those cigarette butts from winding up on the ground in the first place would be the best option, but it would require a pretty big shift in human behavior.

## [A New Specialized Train Is Ready to Haul Nuclear Waste](https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-waste-train-car)


Nuclear power plants are on track to generate more than 140,000 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) before 2060. Every year, 2,000 tonnes of radioactive heavy metal join the growing inventory of fuel removed from nuclear power reactors—both operating and decommissioned. In the coming decades, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will need to transport that material to future storage facilities. This material was never intended to stay at these sites long-term.

## [This Neurodivergent Engineer’s Strategy for Success](https://spectrum.ieee.org/neurodivergent-engineer-strategy-for-success)


Being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder as a child hasn’t hindered computer engineer Roberto Moreno from reaching his goals. ASD, a neurodevelopmental disorder, impacts how a person behaves, learns, perceives the world, and socializes with others. Moreno, an IEEE member, is a technical leader for AgenciaSur , a Chilean company that develops tools to help businesses digitize their operations. He manages six employees at the Santiago location.

## [A Trillion Rogue Planets and Not One Sun to Shine on Them](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rogue-planet)


On 29 October 2020, astronomer Przemek Mróz from the University of Warsaw and an international group of collaborators reported a peculiar flicker of light originating from halfway across our galaxy. The signal, designated OGLE-2016-BLG-1928, was extremely subtle. It caused a single star to brighten and dim by about 20 percent over a 6-hour period, just once, never repeated. “It’s always exciting when you find a truly new thing. This is why I became a scientist,” Mróz says. K. Meech et al. B. S.”

## [Deepfake Porn Is Leading to a New Protection Industry](https://spectrum.ieee.org/deepfake-porn)


It’s horrifyingly easy to make deepfake pornography of anyone thanks to today’s generative AI tools. A 2023 report by Home Security Heroes (a company that reviews identity-theft protection services) found that it took just one clear image of a face and less than 25 minutes to create a 60-second deepfake pornographic video—for free. Others in the entertainment industry, most notably Korean pop stars, have also seen their images taken and misused—but so have people far from the public spotlight.C.

The semiconductor laser, invented more than 60 years ago, is the foundation of many of today’s technologies including barcode scanners, fiber-optic communications, medical imaging, and remote controls. The tiny, versatile device is now an IEEE Milestone . The possibilities of laser technology had set the scientific world alight in 1960, when the laser, long described in theory, was first demonstrated. Three U.S. The three— General Electric , IBM’s Thomas J.S.J., was one of them.Y.—silenced them.

## [Soft Robot Can Amputate and Reattach Its Own Legs](https://spectrum.ieee.org/soft-modular-robot)


Among the many things that humans cannot do (without some fairly substantial modification) is shifting our body morphology around on demand. It sounds a little extreme to be talking about things like self-amputation, and it is a little extreme, but it’s also not at all uncommon for other animals to do—lizards can disconnect their tails to escape a predator, for example. It’s a little freaky to watch, but it kind of makes me wish I could do the same thing. Woodman, Eugene Thomas, Liana G. .
