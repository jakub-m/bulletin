## [Localhost will inevitably die](https://lucasfcosta.com/2023/09/11/localhost-will-die.html)


Localhost is the inevitable victim of every software’s commercial success. Assume you’re a fintech running a Ruby on Rails monolith. If you ever get to PMF, you’ll inevitably have to scale to process more transactions, or you’ll have to hire more engineers to build ancillary features. When that happens, you’ll have to break your monolith into microservices so it scales more efficiently or so that multiple teams can deploy software without stepping on each other’s toes.5 hours completely wasted.

## [Introduction to CORS for Go programmers](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/introduction-to-cors-for-go-programmers/)


From its inception, the Web has been a game of whackamole between people finding security holes and exploits, and other people plugging these holes and adding defensive security mechanisms. One of the busiest arenas in this struggle is the interaction between code running on one site (via JavaScript embedded in its page) and other sites; you may have heard about acronyms like XSS, CSRF, SSRF, SOP and CORS - they are all related to this dynamic and fascinating aspect of modern computer security.

In 2022 we decided that we need to migrate all our MongoDB databases from existing shared clusters to new MongoDB clusters hosted on Kubernetes pods with separated resources. To perform the migration of all databases we needed a tool for transfering all the data and keeping consistency between old and new databases. That’s how mongo-migration-stream project was born.g..

## [Tesla wins](https://world.hey.com/dhh/tesla-wins-e2d68ff3)


When we first got our Tesla Model X four years ago, I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan. Build quality was spotty, brakes didn&#39;t match the performance, and handling was at best so-so. But it could carry seven, including luggage, was electric, and the dual-motor acceleration was a hoot. So it stayed in the garage, pending competition on these criteria. Well, now we got a Mercedes EQS SUV, which also carries seven, is electric, and is fun-fast for its size. Their verdict was unanimous. It&#39;s fascinating.

Flamingo , known as the Flux Subsystem for Argo (FSA), integrates Flux CD and Argo CD, two leading tools in the GitOps landscape. By introducing Flamingo, DevOps teams can harness both tools without compromising the strengths of either. The Flamingo container image is designed to extend the equivalent Argo CD version, enabling users to visualize and manage Flux CD workloads within Argo CD. Flamingo bridges these tools, allowing teams to access Flux CD features directly via the Argo CD interface.

When this is the case, developers and cluster operators rely on Container Storage Interface (CSI) implementations to provide local storage for Pods.

Most managers have internalized the idea that team growth, in and of itself, is a unalloyed good, and a sign of success. This is wrong, but it’s understandable. Team growth feels like success, but headcount by itself isn’t a measure of success. Instead, we should judge management success by impact and efficiency.

## [DNS is the new BGP](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2023-09/service-routing.html)


One of the big changes within the Internet over the last decade or so has been the shift to replicated services. Service replication allows each individual service point to be positioned closer to clusters of users. The question now becomes who (and how) selects the &#34;best&#34; service point to use in response to each user&#39;s service request. It seems that in many cases the answer is the DNS, and not the BGP routing protocol.

It&#39;s challenging to measure the uptake of DNSSEC in the DNS. There are just so many aspects of the DNS that are occluded from view! How many DNS names are there in the DNS? How many of these are signed? How many queries are processed by DNS infrastructure? How many queries add DNSSEC validcation. We present a new measurement here which is a query-weighted view of the DNS, looking the amount of queries for DNS names that are DNSSEC-signed as a proportion of the total query load.

## [Metastable failures in the wild](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2023/09/metastable-failures-in-wild.html)


This paper appeared in OSDI&#39;22. There is a great summary of the paper by Aleksey (one of the authors and my former PhD student, go Aleksey!). There is also a great conference presentation video from Lexiang. Below I will provide a brief overview of the paper followed by my discussion points. This topic is very interesting and important, so I hope you have fun learning about this. Hopefully this queue is going to decrease as the system catches up and you&#39;ll be good. Also checkout 4.c and 6.c. 2.

On today&#39;s sponsored Heavy Networking we talk with Fortinet about how it converges network and security across the breadth of its portfolio. Fortinet is best known for its firewalls, but the company also offers campus and branch switches, has a wireless portfolio, offers SD-WAN and SASE, provides AI-supported operations, and more. We also talk about Fortinet&#39;s approach to the branch office that rethinks networking, security, and performance.

## [Heavy Networking 699: Connecting Multicloud Kubernetes Clusters With Virtual Application Networks](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/heavy-networking-699-connecting-multicloud-kubernetes-clusters-with-virtual-application-networks/)


Virtual Application Networks, or VANs, are today’s Heavy Networking topic. Our guest is Ted Ross, motive force behind the Skupper.io project. Skupper builds VANs in Kubernetes clusters that are conceptually like a VLAN or VPN, except that all the magic happens at layer 7. Skupper is based on the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP), making it effectively a message bus used to interconnect application messages inside of mTLS tunnels running on top of whatever L3 network is available.

Discover one of the most efficient sorting algorithms Introduction Quicksort is probably the most popular sorting algorithm. In many experiments, it was shown that on average it performs better than other sorting methods like merge sort or heap sort . Quicksort is based on the idea of recursively splitting an array into two parts: the first which contains all the elements that are less than a pivot element and the second which consists of greater elements. This procedure is called partition .

Heap imposes the following rules for its structure: Completeness . Every level of the heap is completely filled with elements. However, the last level may be partially filled with elements starting from the left. Heap rule .

## [Making Sense of React Server Components](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/server-components/)


This year, the React team unveiled something they&#39;ve been quietly researching for years: an official way to run React components exclusively on the server. This is a significant paradigm shift, and it&#39;s caused a whole lot of confusion in the React community. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll explore this new world, and build an intuition for how it works, and how we can take advantage of it.

## [Data Binding in React](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/data-binding/)


As developers, we don&#39;t like working with forms, but they&#39;re a critical part of most web applications! In this tutorial, you&#39;ll learn exactly how to wire up all of the different form controls in React. Never forget how to data-bind a checkbox or radio button again!

## [A World-Class Code Playground with Sandpack](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/next-level-playground/)


No developer blog or technical documentation site is complete without an interactive code playground. The CodeSandbox team recently released a wonderful tool called Sandpack, to help us create these live-updating code editors. In this tutorial, I&#39;ll show you how I use it on this blog.

## [Understanding useMemo and useCallback](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/usememo-and-usecallback/)


What&#39;s the deal with these two hooks?! Lots of devs find them confusing, for a whole host of reasons. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll dig deep and understand what they do, why they&#39;re useful, and how to get the most out of them.

## [Why React Re-Renders](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/why-react-re-renders/)


In React, we don&#39;t update the DOM directly, we tell React what we want the DOM to look like, and React tackles the rest. But how exactly does it do this? In this tutorial, we&#39;ll unpack exactly when and why React re-renders, and how we can use this information to optimize the performance of our React apps.

## [Statements Vs. Expressions](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/statements-vs-expressions/)


One of the most foundational things to understand about JavaScript is that programs are made up of statements, and statements have slots for expressions. In this blog post, we&#39;ll dig into how these two structures work, and see how building an intuition about this can help us solve practical problems.

## [Delightful React File/Directory Structure](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/file-structure/)


How should we structure components and other files in our React apps? I&#39;ve iterated my way to a solution I&#39;m really happy with. In this blog post, I&#39;ll share how it works, what the tradeoffs are, and how I mitigate them.

## [Demystifying styled-components](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/demystifying-styled-components/)


For so many React devs, styled-components seems kinda magical. It isn&#39;t at all clear how it uses traditional CSS features under-the-hood, and that lack of clarity can cause real problems when things go awry. In this post, we&#39;ll learn exactly how styled-components works by building our own mini-version.

## [Announcing “use-sound”, a React Hook for Sound Effects](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/announcing-use-sound-react-hook/)


By and large, using the web is a visual experience. This is in terrible contrast to mobile apps, which interact with three of our human senses (sight, sound, and touch, through haptic feedback). I just released a library to make it easy to add sound to your React app, and I make the case that you should consider using it!

## [The Perils of Hydration](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/the-perils-of-rehydration/)


A surprisingly-common misconception can lead to big rendering issues that are difficult to debug. This deep-dive tutorial examines how React and Gatsby can be used to pre-render content, and how we can work around the constraints to build dynamic, personalized web apps.
