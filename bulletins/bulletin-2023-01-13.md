## [ Reconfiguring Replicated Atomic Storage](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2023/01/reconfiguring-replicated-atomic-storage.html)


Reconfiguration is a rich source of faults in distributed systems. If you don&#39;t reconfigure, you lose availability when you lose additional nodes. But the reconfiguration algorithms are subtle, and it is easy to get them wrong, and lose consistency during reconfiguration. This is because a reconfiguration operation is run concurrently with the read/write operations and with potentially other reconfiguration operations, and they run when the system is already in some turmoil due to faults.e. . ..

This article was discussed on reddit . SDL has grown on me over the past year. I didn’t understand its value until viewing it in the right lens: as a complete platform and runtime replacing the host’s runtime, possibly including libc. Ideally an SDL application links exclusively against SDL and otherwise not directly against host libraries, though in practice it’s somewhat porous. SDL applications are always interesting one way or another, so I like to dig in when I come across them.)...exe app.

There are many different terms used in the world of cloud-native software delivery – and the lexicon seems to be growing all the time. From continuous integration to continuous delivery and continuous deployment, they can certainly be confusing to novices – and in some cases, to experts too. In this article, we go back to basics and explain what is commonly meant by some of the most frequently used terms. Continuous integration (CI) was developed in answer to these pressures.

Computer Things: 2021 Edition It’s over a year late, I know, but the 2021 Newsletter collection is now available to purchase as a PDF . 70,000 words, 250 pages, 20 bucks. Unlike last year, there’s no private subscriber-only emails, so this is purely for people who want to read it on the go / give me money. I might add a postmortem review or an introduction piece if there’s enough interest. But I think it’s important to give things a fair shake, even if I don’t like them. 1. 2.

2021 saw the completion of my first substantial free software project: a TLA⁺ grammar for tree-sitter, the error-tolerant incremental parser generator. The project stabilized &amp; found users over the course of 2022, then over the holidays I used it to build the TLA⁺ Unicode Converter. The new year is a time to reflect on the past and look to the future, so here in early 2023 seems ideal to publish my experience.

You will face platitudes weaker than the industrial toilet paper your startup switched to as they tried to rein in costs. That is my goal for this piece. Atomic operations don&#39;t make your code wait-free, lock-free, or even obstruction-free.

We often have to represent in software a value that might be missing. Different programming languages have abstraction for this purpose. A recent version of C&#43;&#43; (C&#43;&#43;17) introduces std::optional templates. It is kind of neat.

## [Management Debt](https://staysaasy.com/management/2023/01/12/management-debt.html)


Teams naturally start to incur management debt as they grow and become more complex, just as codebases incur tech debt. The combined weight of past decisions creates a web of precedents and exceptions that can cause problems of varying size over time. For a concrete example of management debt, consider a team that’s never had performance reviews. They’ve saved time by skipping reviews, but have taken on significant management debt by not setting expectations or addressing over/under performance.

Some of this behavior was good and appropriate. As the talent market heated up: Employers paid more and recruited harder. They also made job requirements more flexible, allowing for people with non-traditional backgrounds to have more opportunities. I.e. People working multiple remote jobs at once.g.g.

## [Using Ninja Build to Build Projects Faster](https://earthly.dev/blog/ninjabuild-for-faster-build/)


Ninja is a compact build system with a focus on fast incremental builds. It was originally developed by Evan Martin , a Google dev, partly in response to the needs of building large projects such as Google Chrome. If you’re developing a software system and you require a rebuild every few minutes to test your latest feature or code block, then Ninja will only rebuild what you have just modified or added and nothing else—as opposed to Make , which would rebuild the whole project every single time.

When it comes to security in Kubernetes, it is vital to secure the individual resources of the cluster. Pods and containers are considered the core resources running in the cluster and are the fundamental building block of Kubernetes workloads. Applying security to the pod and container layer can have a huge impact on the overall security of your cluster. By default, Kubernetes pods have root access.

Identity thieves have been exploiting a glaring security weakness in the website of Experian, one of the big three consumer credit reporting bureaus. Normally, Experian requires that those seeking a copy of their credit report successfully answer several multiple choice questions about their financial history. But until the end of 2022, Experian&#39;s website allowed anyone to bypass these questions and go straight to the consumer&#39;s report.

## [They&#39;re rebuilding the Death Star of complexity](https://world.hey.com/dhh/they-re-rebuilding-the-death-star-of-complexity-4fb5d08d)


I started my career in programming during heydays of Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE). This was late 90s/early 00s, and there was a rich ecosystem of enterprise vendors hawking application servers, monitoring tools, and boxes upon boxes of other fancy solutions. These tools were difficult to learn, expensive to license, and required an army of contractors, consultants, and sales people to purchase, configure, and run. But that the ratio between Good Idea and Bullshit was completely out of whack.

We spent the last couple of months thinking that bringing HEY home from the cloud was going to involve SUSE Rancher and Harvester. A combination of enterprisey software products that would give us a cloud-like experience on our own hardware, and require minimal changes to how HEY is already packaged and deployed. We spend about three million dollars per year on renting hardware and services in the cloud. Now at first, we actually thought this wasn&#39;t going to be an issue. Three percent...

## [Ultimate Go: Advanced Engineering Episode 15](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2023/01/ultimate-go-advanced-engineering-episode-15.html)


Introduction In episode 14, Bill architected a solution to digitally sign the transactions on his blockchain. His solution retrieved the private key by : loading private key data from disk, parsing the key data and returning the ECDSA private key. The private key is then used to generate the signature of a transaction. While writing the code to perform this functionality, Bill highlighted how a blockchain node can use a transaction’s signature to extrapolate the public key.

Introduction Google developed Go to be an alternative to C&#43;&#43; with the internet and scale in mind. Go’s toolchain automates tasks that are easily overlooked, and amongst those tasks is generating documentation. Go has the ability to generate documentation based on comments written in your source code. As the end user, you have the choice to view this documentation in your terminal or, if your code is publicly accessible, on pkg.

Introduction In episode 12, Bill laid out his strategy to handle data hashing on his blockchain. The first step he took was to create a package to handle the cryptographical aspects of his blockchain. After that, he wrote a hash function that met the requirements outlined in his strategy. This function took transaction data as a parameter and returned a hexadecimal representation of the hash. To implement this function, Bill imported packages from the Go standard library and Ethereum API.

## [Ultimate Go: Advanced Engineering Episode 14](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2023/01/ultimate-go-advanced-engineering-episode-14.html)


Introduction In episode 13, Bill discussed the idea of adding salt to a hash and how modern crypto-currency blockchains use it to better interpret requests sent to nodes. He continued by defining a function called stamp that embeds a salt within a hash. While writing the function, Bill stated that he would use keccak256 as it’s the same algorithm used by Ethereum to generate hash values. Bill will use the APIs provided with Go Ethereum to generate a keccak256 hash.

Introduction Most machine learning models require the input features to be in numerical format and if the features are in categorial format, pre-processing steps such as one-hot encoding are needed to convert them into numerical format. Converting a large number of categorical values may lead to creating sparse features, a set of features that contains mostly zero or empty values. We are happy to announce a new functionality that supports sparse features in BigQuery .wagtailcore.rich_text.
