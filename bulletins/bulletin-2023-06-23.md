## [Metaprogramming in Zig and parsing CSS](http://notes.eatonphil.com/2023-06-19-metaprogramming-in-zig-and-parsing-css.html)


I knew Zig supported some sort of reflection on types. But I had been confused about how to use it. What&#39;s the difference between @typeInfo and @TypeOf ? I ignored this aspect of Zig until a problem came up at work where reflection made sense. The situation was parsing and storing parsed fields in a struct. Each field name that is parsed should match up to a struct field. This is a fairly common problem. I live-streamed the implementation of this project yesterday on Twitch .heap.init(arena.&#34;, .

A common failure mode in complex systems is that some part of the system hits a limit and falls over. In the software world, we call this phenomenon resource exhaustion, and a classic example of this is running out of memory. The simplest solution to this problem is to “provision for peak”: to build out … Continue reading Resilience requires helping each other out →

Along with my production servers, like FotoForensics , Hintfo , and this blog, I run a bunch of honeypot systems. These honeypots provide a great baseline for identifying the typical attack levels on the internet. (If you have a system on the internet and you don&#39;t think you&#39;re being attacked, then you&#39;re not watching your logs.) Honeypots also allow me to run a variety of A/B Tests. Every single network security option deployed on my production sites can be compared to the honeypot results.g.5.

Co-authors: Shivansh Mundra, Gonzalo Aniano Porcile, Smit Marvaniya, Hany Farid A core part of what we do on the Trust Data Team at LinkedIn is create, deploy, and maintain models that detect and prevent many types of abuse. This spans the detection and prevention of fake accounts, account takeovers, and policy-violating content. We are constantly working to improve and increase the effectiveness of our anti-abuse defenses to protect the experiences of our members and customers.

Recently I’ve been chatting with a number of companies who are building out internal LLM labs/tools for their teams to make it easy to test LLMs against their internal usecases. I wanted to take a couple hours to see how far I could get using Streamlit to build out a personal LLM lab for a few usecases of my own. See code on lethain/llm-explorer .DataFrame({ &#39;first column&#39;: [1, 2, 3, 4], &#39;second column&#39;: [10, 20, 30, 40] }) df Which we can then run via: streamlit run main.dataframe(df.style.g.)

I’ve reached my goal and, though it’s not a usual topic around here, I wanted to get my thoughts down while fresh. I absolutely loved some of these plays and performances, and so I’d like to highlight them, especially because my favorites are, with one exception, not “popular” plays. I’ll mention notable performances when applicable.g.g.

Avneesh Saluja , Andy Yao , Hossein Taghavi Introduction When watching a movie or an episode of a TV show, we experience a cohesive narrative that unfolds before us, often without giving much thought to the underlying structure that makes it all possible. However, movies and episodes are not atomic units, but rather composed of smaller elements such as frames, shots, scenes, sequences, and acts. Furthermore, some cues can be better inferred from modalities other than the video, e.g.k.a.e.g.g.g.

You may have heard of this new idea called “Agile”, where you prioritize people over processes etc etc etc. I occasionally saw it on Twitter, before I quit that hellsite, after which I kinda lost track of it. But I recently started clout-mining LinkedIn and now see see a lot more posts about Agile. I think it’s almost mainstream! Like any idea that picks up steam, people are now disagreeing on how to actually do Agile. Other people argue that all this praxis is missing the point of Agile.  ↩

Saying no can seem risky. We worry about offending others, damaging relationships, or hurting our own reputation. But as Vanessa Patrick says, no is an empowering word that gives us greater agency in our lives. Saying no “is not a rejection of the other person,” says Patrick , a professor of Marketing at the University of Houston. Instead, it allows you to set boundaries and “[give] voice to what you believe and what you care about. More Resources: https://www.linkedin.gsb.stanford.

Bélády&#39;s Anomaly Doesn&#39;t Happen Often Anomaly is a really fun word. Try saying it ten times. It was 1969. The Summer of Love wasn&#39;t raging 4 , Hendrix was playing the anthem, and Forest Gump was running rampant. In New York, IBM researchers Bélády, Nelson, and Schedler were hot on the trail of something strange. They had a paging machine , a computer which kept its memory in pages , and sometimes moved those pages to storage. Weird 1 . Sometimes, giving the machine more memory made it slower.

What is a container? What are words, anyway? A common cause of confusion and miscommunication I see is different people using different definitions of words. Sometimes the definitions are subtly different (as with availability ). Sometimes they&#39;re completely different, and we&#39;re just talking about different things entirely. A common example is the word container , a popular term for a popular technology that means at least four different things. Those people include me.

I am happy to see that I am able to follow most talks well. I also enjoyed meeting and talking with many database people in coffee breaks and the receptions. Today, day 1, was the PODS conference.

In fact, the process of &#34;crypting&#34; malware is sufficiently complex and time-consuming that most serious cybercrooks will outsource this critical function to a handful of trusted third parties.

It&#39;s rarely the terrible decisions, processes, or even people that&#39;ll sink your organization. It&#39;s the accumulation and inertia of the mediocre ones. Dealing with the truly bad is easy. It&#39;s painfully obvious to all that change is required. The danger is imminent. It&#39;s much harder to find the will to act when the danger lurks in inadequate urgency, cumbersome collaboration, or just a missing spark. But act you must, before inertia sets in to devour you whole. Hard choices, easy life.

Since the pandemic ended, we&#39;ve had the pleasure of organizing three different company meet-ups for 37signals. We got going again in Miami, then hopped to Amsterdam, and most recently we went to New Orleans. Next we&#39;re going to Barcelona in the fall. Perhaps, again, a tad more charming in Amsterdam than Miami, but New Orleans was pretty nice too. One of the surprising expenses in the US was just getting around. In Miami, we spent well over $10,000 just on cabs and Ubers. About half and half.

It&#39;s hard to know what&#39;ll stick around when shopping for software online. Popular services and crucial products get shut down all the time. You can&#39;t even trust that major conglomerates like Google to provide something you can count on two-five-ten years from now. And if you&#39;re betting on something backed by venture capital , well, you know that the odds of permanence are as long as can be. It needn&#39;t be this way. Look at some of the most beloved brands of the 20th century.

Google will eventually kill every single service you care about , if they can&#39;t find a way to directly monetize it with ads at a scale of billions. They&#39;re institutionally incapable of being in the product or service business, because neither products nor services butter Google&#39;s bread. Advertisement does. You can see this emphasis in a myriad of ways, but my favorite lens is customer service. All I&#39;m saying is you better have a backup plan.

It&#39;s hard to think original thoughts if your senses are being perpetually flooded with everything from everyone all the time. And it&#39;s hard to protect your senses against this if you&#39;re constantly in close mental proximity to those who&#39;ve had success running the established script. To escape back to first principles, you need to consciously turn down the volume on the world. Physically, spiritually, and mentally. Right from the start. This was before social media. Now it&#39;s more work.
