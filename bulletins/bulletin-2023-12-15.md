As the legend goes, a moth once walked into a podiatrist’s office and complained about being mistreated by his boss, his loveless marriage to his moth wife and his estranged moth children. He went as far as identifying the cowardice he sees in his son’s eyes as his own cowardice that’s holding him back from ending his own life. Horrified upon hearing all this, the understandably confused podiatrist asks him why he wouldn’t go to a psychiatrist instead of a podiatrist.

I usually follow a simple mantra: if it can be automated then it should be automated. However, while automation may seem like a great solution, it introduces a new set of perils. Unexpected critical points, untested conditions, and unforeseen failures can lead to new problems. At FotoForensics , Hintfo , and my other services, I use a lot of automation. I have tools that detect and respond to network attacks, terms of use violations, server monitoring, and basic system management. (Seriously.

If you are a doctor who treats patients with lung cancer, it does not take long to notice numbers like that.

A common pattern when scaling a SaaS application is to deploy your stack to multiple regions across the globe. Deploying to multiple regions helps distribute the application and data closer to the user, and isolates infrastructure in case of an outage in a single region. If your application is deployed in this configuration, you have the new problem of routing users to the correct region based on their tenancy or geography.

Approachability in Programming Languages On /r/rust , I quite often see something like this: I’ve been learning Rust for the past 3 months and now comparing it with my experience of learning C&#43;&#43;, I think it’s a lot more difficult. There are so many rules that you need to understand to efficiently program in Rust, including(but not limited to): ownership, the borrow checker, cargo, lifetimes, traits, generics, closures, unsafe Rust, etc. Why is that? Well, language design is about trade-offs. ↩︎

containerd is a leading container runtime that manages the complete lifecycle of the containers running on your system. It provides an interface that higher-level tools like Docker can use to start and manage containers. Originally, Docker used its own container runtime to perform these functions. However, this approach proved restrictive as the container ecosystem grew. As a result, Docker spun its runtime out into a separate CNCF-maintained containerd project at the end of 2016. ARM64).12.0 ..

And I mean nature in the broadest possible sense. The evening light. The rustling of the leaves. A pair of eagles circling above your head. The colors of a beautiful sunset or sunrise.

I grew up in a home where music was always playing. My father repaired electronics, so an endless stream of speakers, amplifiers, turntables, and TVs passed through the household. And all of it had to be tested, of course. At max volume. Sometimes at odd hours. While that was frequently a bit of a nuisance, it did seed a deep appreciation for musical experiences in me. Founded on the fact that music can sound very differently depending on the equipment that conveys it. So I did. They&#39;re sublime.

## [Towards application capabilities](https://tailscale.com/blog/acl-grants)


The Tailscale policy file shapes your tailnet, by letting you define who can access what, how devices connect, and even how IP addresses are assigned to nodes. At the heart of this policy file lies the ACLs section, which holds the access rules for your network. The Tailscale policy engine evaluates these rules and sends them to all your clients, enabling each one to independently check permissions without relying on the coordination server.

One day, the theory goes, we humans will create AI systems that outmatch us intellectually. That could be great if they solve problems that we’ve been thus far unable to crack (think cancer or climate change), or really bad if they begin to act in ways that are not in humanity’s best interests, and we’re not smart enough to stop them. OpenAI is devoting 20 percent of its compute to this effort, and hopes to have solutions by 2027. Just how much more powerful is GPT-4? While GPT-2 has 1.5.”

The quality of a camera is typically limited by its size and ability to let in a lot of light. In smaller cameras, lenses can help improve the image quality to an extent, but new approaches are instead looking to improve cameras by modifying the sensors that convert rays of light into electrical signals. This increases the amount of light each pixel receives while maintaining a small pixel size. Two of these use nano-scale metasurfaces , namely prisms and pillars, to improve CMOS sensitivity.

Neuromorphic computing has so far tried to mimic the synapses between neurons in the brain. But a new approach instead aims to act like dendrites, the spindly structures that branch out from the nucleus of a neuron like the roots of a tree. Dendrites receive signals from other neurons via synapses, transmitting them from tip to stem to the nucleus. In computing, “nanodendrites” could function similarly, according to a team of researchers at Stanford University.-S. incorrect sequence.”
