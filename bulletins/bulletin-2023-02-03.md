The conclusion of my blog posts on the LastPass breach and on Bitwarden’s design flaws is invariably: a strong master password is important. This is especially the case if you are a target somebody would throw considerable resources at.

Introduction Go interfaces are beneficial to Go developers because they: Allow interfaces to separate mechanism from behavior. Increase flexibility of function parameters. Enable mocking of function parameters. With the addition of generics in Go 1.18, interfaces can be used to constrain the types of values a generic function will accept. To dive deeper into Go interfaces, we invite you to join Miki in his latest series dedicated to Go interfaces.

This paper is from Sigmod 2010, and compares the two standard TPC benchmarks for OLTP, TPC-C which came in 1992, and the TPC-E which dropped in 2007. TPC-E is designed to be a more realistic and sophisticated OLTP benchmark than TPC-C by incorporating realistic data skews and referential integrity constraints. However, because of its complexity, TPC-E is more difficult to implement, and hard to provide reproducability of the results by others. As a result adoption had been very slow and little..

The Go Blog Go 1.20 is released! Robert Griesemer, on behalf of the Go team 1 February 2023 Today the Go team is thrilled to release Go 1.20, which you can get by visiting the download page . Go 1.20 benefited from an extended development phase, made possible by earlier broad testing and improved overall stability of the code base. Providing a profile to go build enables the compiler to speed up typical applications by around 3–4%, and we expect future releases to benefit even more from PGO.17.

My online metadata viewer service, Hintfo , has been watching for any file formats that have little or no metadata support. It recently sent me an alert, informing me that the MIDI file format fits this problem space. The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) file format is really old, like from 1983 . This means that MIDI doesn&#39;t have metadata in any of the standardized formats (EXIF, XMP, IPTC, etc.) because it predates all of them. There are plenty of really old and obsolete formats.

I wanted to practice making coding videos so I did a four-part series on writing a basic Scheme-like language (minus macros and arrays and tons of stuff). I picked this simple topic because I wanted a low-stakes way to learn what I did not know about making videos. Here was the end result (nothing crazy): $ go build $ cat examples/fib.scm (func fib (a) (if (&lt; a 2) a (&#43; (fib (- a 1)) (fib (- a 2))))) (fib 11) $ ./livescheme examples/fib.scm 89 The code for the project is here .

If you can reproduce the issue locally with a debugger attached you’ll have access to these local variables, but with Sentry you can identify the exception location *without* needing to reproduce the issue locally.

Interop 2022 showed significant improvements in the interoperability of multiple platform features, along with several cross-browser investigations that looked into complex, under-specified, areas of the platform where interoperability has been difficult to achieve. Building on this, we&#39;re pleased to announce Interop 2023, the next iteration of the Interop project. The post Announcing Interop 2023 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog .

## [Monitor GCE instances with Prometheus and Ops Agent](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/monitor-gce-instances-with-prometheus-and-ops-agent/)


If you’ve worked in the operations space for the last 5&#43; years, you’ve likely heard of or have started using Prometheus. The proliferation of Prometheus for time series metrics formatting, querying and storage across the open source world and enterprise IT has been shockingly fast, especially with teams using Kubernetes platforms like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Maybe not so much. Maybe that even means rolling your own RPM to maintain this and managing the SLAs for this daemonized version.

Building large-scale systems can be challenging. Systems that are predictable and reliable on a smaller scale can become chaotic and uncontrollable when scaled up, revealing the limits of your design, exhibiting suboptimal performance, or even not working. To mitigate these effects, it’s important to test large-scale systems before deploying them in production. But predicting system performance and reliability when scaling up can be a complex task that requires extra care.wagtailcore.rich_text.
