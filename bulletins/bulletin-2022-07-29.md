The search for the ultimate folder structure for a given project can be compared to the search for the holy grail . It does not matter if it is a frontend app written with React, Go CLI tool, or a project of UI design. At the start, you will always face the question of how you should structure it. Why are we doing it? Because we want our projects to be flexible, extensible, self-explanatory, and easy to maintain. It provides a seamless developer experience for engineers working on that project..

## [Tailscale for DevOps: On-demand access to your Tailscale resources with Indent](https://tailscale.com/blog/indent/)


As your teams grow and become more distributed, it makes sense to limit an employee’s access based on their job function rather than to give everyone persistent access to your production environment. This not only lets you manage sensitive resources such as customer data more effectively, but it also reduces the risk of accidentally impacting production — for example, by running a query meant for your staging environment. When the time is up, the user’s access is automatically revoked.

I’ve been trying to run search ads on Google for over a month. Due to two unrelated snags, I’ve only had ~12 hours of uptime with those ads in that time. Based on conversations with other startups that run Google Ads, my experience is neither unique nor surprising. Apropos of Google’s earnings day, I wanted to vent a bit about how hard Google makes it to use the product that drives so much of their revenue.

Part 4 focused on the memory consumption of a CNN and revealed that neural networks require parameter data (weights) and input data (activations) to generate the computations. Most machine learning is linear algebra at its core; therefore, training and inference rely heavily on the arithmetic capabilities of the platform. By default, neural network architectures use the […] The post Training vs Inference – Numerical Precision appeared first on frankdenneman.nl .

Introduction “We enjoyed the competition.” “Such a great event!” — such was the feedback heard from participants at this year’s Kaggle Days, a series of non-profit events for experienced data scientists. This event is a lot of fun, a hefty dose of knowledge, and a unique opportunity to meet the best in the industry and learn from Kaggle Grandmasters. During each event, three winning teams are selected, who will then be invited to participate in the offline finals in Barcelona.

## [ Automated Validation of State-Based Client-Centric Isolation with TLA&#43; (2021)](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/07/automated-validation-of-state-based.html)


This work provides a TLA&#43; formalization of t he state-based isolation model introduced in the PODC 2017 paper. The TLA&#43; models provided here will be very useful for you if you are a distributed database developer. Using these, you can show your database protocols satisfy the desired isolation levels, and as you extend the design, you can keep checking that the guarantees still hold. I have been suffering from this problem recently. I wrote a TLA&#43; model for a distributed database design...

## [MCH2022: DNA and GPS/Galileo/GNSS Talks](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/mch-dna-and-gps-gnss-talks/)


(scroll down for my two talks if you are in a hurry) As I write this I’m suffering from severe post-camp blues. Every four years the Dutch hacker community organizes a stupendously large multi-day campsite event, with ample international help. To a large extent, “everyone” is there. And this time, like every time, people who originally decided they could not make it.. show up by day two. Because the pull is just too strong.

Modern game controllers can point in a wide range of directions. Game designers sometimes want to convert the joystick direction to get 8-directional movement. A typical solution offered is to compute the angle, round it up and then compute back the direction vector. double angle = atan2(y, x); angle = (int(round(4 * angle / PI &#43; … Continue reading Round a direction vector to an 8-way compass

Pub/Sub ’s ingestion of data into BigQuery can be critical to making your latest business data immediately available for analysis. Until today, you had to create intermediate Dataflow jobs before your data could be ingested into BigQuery with the proper schema. While Dataflow pipelines (including ones built with Dataflow Templates) get the job done well, sometimes they can be more than what is needed for use cases that simply require raw data with no transformation to be exported to BigQuery.

The number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs stretches into the millions , and a critical part of the problem is the length of time it takes to backfill a position. Industry group ISACA has found that the average cybersecurity position lies vacant for up to six months. Training new analysts can be a daunting task.
