                        Connections between Tailscale nodes are already secured with end-to-end encryption —that’s a huge benefit of being built on WireGuard. However, browsers are not aware of that because they rely on verifying the TLS certificate of a domain. To protect a website with an HTTPS URL, you need a TLS certificate from a public Certificate Authority. Your browser doesn’t know about Tailscale Tailscale is built on WireGuard. This is done by verifying the validity of a TLS certificate for that domain .

                        As you start developing an AI/ML based solution, you quickly figure out that you need to run workflows. Not only that, you might need to run those workflows across various kinds of infrastructure (including GPUs) at scale. Ville Tuulos developed MetaFlow while working at Netflix to help data scientists scale their work. In this episode, Ville tells us a bit more about MetaFlow, his new book on data science infrastructure, and his approach to helping scale ML/AI work.

Working every day on keeping the open-source community in sync with the core team was an important lesson. The second learning was around big changes between major versions.

The first of these demos, ‘ Google Maps Platform WebGL-powered Maps Features ,’ walks developers through each of the WebGL features and how they can be used effectively. The documentation didn’t even exist yet.

                        When companies can optimize their pricing to take into account market conditions dynamically, they can use it as an important lever for differentiation.   In order to optimize pricing, organizations need to be able to respond to market changes faster, which means optimizing for a continuum of decisions (such as list price or promotions) and context (such as localization or special occasion) to serve the function of multiple business objectives (such as net revenue growth or cross-selling).com .

However, the path and technologies to become a data-driven innovator are different and success comes from implementing the right tech in a way that matches a company&#39;s culture. Not all organizations are alike. In practice, all companies are a mixture of all these functions.

APIs come in various styles such as REST, gRPC, GraphQL, and AsyncAPI, and each style has its own features. Picking the right API style completely depends on your use case and what you are solving for. Associate GraphQL with API products... Read Article

Gatrel&#39;s conviction comes roughly two weeks after his co-conspirator pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to running the services.

The field saw much interest during the 1980s and early 1990s. A more serious essay would talk about them separately. Early formal methods only focused on abstract correctness .  ↩

                        By Melissa Strait, Chief Compliance Officer At Coinbase, we think about compliance a little differently than most companies. Over the coming months, we plan to give the public a look “under the hood” at the programs and technologies we use to keep our customers safe and keep bad actors off our platforms. In addition, we will be publishing a series of research papers that explore some of the biggest challenges that our compliance teams face on a daily basis. However, Coinbase is changing that.

                        L.J. Brock, Chief People Officer I joined Coinbase in March 2019, and I quickly realized that to get stuff done, you generally had to be at Coinbase — in the conference room, in the hallway conversation, at the lunch table — working, chatting and collaborating side-by-side with your colleagues. Sure, employees worked from home here and there, but doing so always carried the risk of leaving you slightly out of the loop. Of course, COVID changed all that. (Hint: the company’s culture is key. 1. 2.

                        Organizations rely on their development teams to stay competitive in a fast-moving world of cloud-native applications. Yet, these developers are slowed down by operational hassles, red tape, and silos that exist within the organization. The result is that new features are deployed late, and even when deployed, potentially not stable. Highly mature DevOps organizations encountered a solution: empower developers with the autonomy to choose their own tech stack. Head on over now!

                        Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and telecommunications providers (telcos) are seeing a massive shift in technology from legacy backend systems, to modern cloud-native systems that are flexible, and powerful. Here is a summary of our latest white paper covering modern operations for Telcos . Let’s break that down a bit further. Telcos typically handle operations at a massive scale of millions of events per day in near real-time; e.g. Observability is essential for cloud-native to be successful.
