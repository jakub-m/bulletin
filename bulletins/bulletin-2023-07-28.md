## [Queryability and the Sublime Mediocrity of SQL](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/queryability-and-the-sublime-mediocrity-of-sql/)


I&#39;m going to a small academic workshop on design next week. This got me thinking of the various meanings of &#34;design&#34;, which got me thinking about the various purposes of &#34;design&#34;, which got me thinking about queryability . A system is queryable if (and I&#39;m speaking very roughly) you can easily retrieve information you need from the system data. As an example, let&#39;s say we record scientists and the papers they worked on. Which data model is more queryable? Depends on usage patterns.id AND a.  ↩

## [When Good Correlation is Not Enough](https://hakibenita.com/postgresql-correlation-brin-multi-minmax)


Choosing to use a block range index (BRIN) to query a field with high correlation is a no-brainer for the optimizer. However, under some easily reproducible circumstances, a BRIN index can result in significantly slower execution even when the indexed field has very high correlation. In this article I describe how using a BRIN index in presumably &#34;ideal circumstances&#34; can result in degraded performance, and suggest a recent new feature of PostgreSQL as a remedy.

In about 15 years, a desktop computer will be able to do everything a human can. In 25, a mobile phone. Barring a catastrophe, these are facts. What does the future look like for humanity? The only reason we killed all the animals is because the Earth is small. The longest flight is 9,537 miles, and that gets you pretty much anywhere. The names of all the people on the planet can fit in the RAM of a tinybox. The Earth is small. Putting it on the poles which are chock full of water.

Artificial intelligence may well prove one of the most impactful and disruptive technologies to come along in years. We want to understand, support, and contribute to these efforts because we believe that they offer one of the best ways to help ensure that the AI systems that emerge are truly trustworthy. With this in mind, a small team within Mozilla’s innovation group recently undertook a hackathon at our headquarters in San Francisco. Our objective: build a Mozilla internal chatbot prototype.

## [Spanner: Becoming a SQL system ](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2023/07/spanner-becoming-sql-system.html)


This is a VDLB 2017 paper. Last week we reviewed the F1 paper from 2012. It seems like F1 was an experiment and sort of a preview towards adding serious SQL support in Spanner. The original Spanner paper was published in 2012 had little discussion/support for SQL. It was mostly a &#34;transactional NoSQL core&#34;. In the intervening years, though, Spanner has evolved into a relational database system, and many of the SQL features in F1 got incorporated directly in Spanner.

I’ve lost track of all the things that Musk has done to Twitter that ought to have brought it down by now. Scarcely a month goes by without some action triggering the incessant bells of doom, ringing from the bellies of bloviating ding dongs. And the ringing seemingly never stops long enough to allow for some basic contemplation or correction, as reality wrecks another prediction of peril. It’s just on to the next faux outrage of tomorrow. That’s one of the absolute key ingredients in success.

As more and more companies, especially large ones, have started demanding remote workers return to the office, the competitive hiring advantage for remote-first companies is back. And it&#39;s even bigger than before the pandemic, now that so many workers have had a taste of what life can be like when you don&#39;t have to commute to the office. This is great news for smaller companies and startups in particular. The world is full of wonderful, talented people who won&#39;t do this.

After hiring people for twenty years, I&#39;ve come to accept that it&#39;s impossible to know up front what someone is truly capable of. Sure, we try our best to make good, educated guesses during the hiring process, and this is why asking finalists to do sample work projects is so crucial. But it still remains just guessing, and the truth doesn&#39;t emerge until you afford the hire a full attempt on a real project. That&#39;s why I&#39;m such a fan of starting new employees in the deep end . But it is a gamble.

The easiest way to squander your focus is by paying attention to a million inconsequential things at once. These little mental barnacles add up in imperceptible ways until you suddenly feel like you&#39;re getting nowhere, no matter how hard you push. You must keep scrubbing your mind clear of such attention-sapping colonies to remain capable of making smooth, swift progress. These barnacles can accumulate from middling marketing initiatives, process theatre, and tolerance for mediocre performance.

So, do we like generics or not? Some people feared they’d be the end of the language. Others were very hopeful, and had clear use cases, and were thrilled about the feature coming to the language. It was also often touted as the reason a lot of people didn’t adopt Go. So what do we think now? Mat and Kris are joined by Roger Peppe and Bryan Boreham to discuss the state of Generics in Go.

Before I decided to write this article, I knew systemd was the init process in Linux and that it was the process under which all other processes ran. I had run my share of systemctl commands, but truthfully, I just never really needed to learn about it beyond that. I never thought much about how systemd knew which processes to run or what else it could do. I just knew that when a process started, somehow, systemd would take over. It also manages logs.04.2 LTS.Println( &#34;Hello World&#34; ) time.......
