Authors: Mostafa Abdelraouf, Zain Kabani, Andrew Tanner In this post, we’ll be talking about PgCat , an open-source Postgresql Proxy that we have been using in production and contributing to. It provides connection pooling, load-balancing, and replica failover for our Postgresql clusters. At Instacart, we use Postgresql for the vast majority of our database needs. All these strategies are great but they can only go so far. Both techniques, however, come at the cost of added complexity.68ms | 4.

When you opt to use Kubernetes for application deployment , out of the box, it provides a wide range of automation features that make it easy to deploy and manage stateless applications. However, for more complex, stateful applications, additional automation may be required to manage the specific requirements of the application. However, these same principles also limit its initial functionality to a restricted set of commands and operations that are exposed through APIs.mongodb.0.wiredTiger.0.

Process-heavy engineering cultures are like my grandfather’s wallet. They’re stuffed with so many layers of procedures and checklists that by the time you get to the end, you forget what you were trying to accomplish in the first place. It’s like trying to find a single dollar bill in a wallet full of receipts from 1972. In this blog post, I’ll describe how processes are born, the reasons for which they must die, and suggest more effective and less bureaucratic alternatives. Think about it.com .

I was reviewing an electronics textbook the other day, and it made an offhand comment that &#34;sinusoidal signals of the same frequency always add up to a sinusoid, even if their magnitudes and phases are different&#34;. This gave me pause; is that really so? Even with different phases? Using EE notation, a sinusoidal signal with magnitude A_1 , frequency and phase \phi_1 is A_1 sin(wt&#43;\phi_1) [1] . It seems to be working. I guess it&#39;s time to prove it.

When I was at Stripe, I reworked the hiring process for Director-plus engineering managers. My goal was to better evaluate polished senior leaders who always said the right thing. I wanted to find the real beliefs and behaviors underneath all the polish. One interview focused on a direct report sharing a mediocre strategy proposal for review, and getting a signal on whether the candidate could give useful feedback on improving the document. Further, it’s very helpful to see if, e.g.g.

## [Worldwide Repls, part 3: Firing Up The Engines](https://blog.replit.com/geo-part-3-deploy)


At Replit, we operate a cloud-based infrastructure that allows developers to collaborate and create within an all-in-one, integrated development environment. One of the most significant parts of this experience is the latency perceived by the developer when interacting with the workspace. While we can always add resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage on demand, when tackling latency we have to deal with some fundamental physical limits such as the speed of light.

We all carry with us in our heads models about how the world works, which we colloquially refer to as mental models. These models are always incomplete, often stale, and sometimes they’re just plain wrong. For those of us doing operations work, our mental models include our understanding of how the different parts of the … Continue reading Making peace with the imperfect nature of mental models →

## [Characterizing Microservice Dependency and Performance: Alibaba Trace Analysis](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2023/03/characterizing-microservice-dependency.html)


This paper got the best paper award at SOCC 2021 . The paper conducts a comprehensive study of large scale microservices deployed in Alibaba clusters.  They analyze the behavior of more than 20,000 microservices in a 7-day period and profile their characteristics based on the 10 billion call traces collected. They also develop a stochastic model to simulate microservice call graph dependencies and show that it approximates the dataset they collected (which is available at https://github.g.e.e.

## [How to Be a PM That Engineers Don’t Hate](https://staysaasy.com/product/2023/03/12/pm-engineers-dont-hate.html)


You see it everywhere: Engineers complaining about the product managers that they work with. Hating on PMs is kind of like complaining about your utility provider or the TSA – so universal that it’s always good for a light chuckle in the right circles. The PMs don’t know how the technology works. All they do is send emails and take credit. They’re meeting generation machines. This cycle is worth breaking. When the functions work together, everything gets done with focused attention.

Introduction In episode 6, Miki built a logger package with the aim of making it as versatile as possible. To achieve this, he constructed his logger object with a function that would: accept the io.Writer interface as a parameter and perform type assertions to retrieve other interface types as needed. By building this, Miki demonstrated how polymorphism is achieved with Go by changing the type of a variable with type assertions.

Oczywiście nic się nam nie stanie. AI nas nie zabije. To kompletnie idiotyczne. Argumenty Eliezera są spójne i logiczne, ale czynią pewne założenia, które są dyskusyjne. Kiedyś czytałem krótką i gęstą, książkę Józefa M. Bocheńskiego pod tytułem “ Współczesne metody myślenia ”. Bocheński tłumaczy tam, że geometria euklidesowa opiera się na aksjomatach. Aksjomaty są pewnikiem, oczywistością, ale oczywiście można wymyślić spójny system opierający się na odwrotnych lub innych aksjomatach.
