## [The power of single-method interfaces in Go](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/the-power-of-single-method-interfaces-in-go/)


The other day I was pondering on the prevalence of single-method interfaces (SMI) in Go, and what makes them so effective and useful. SMIs have proven to be a very successful software modeling tool for Go programmers, and you find them all over Go code-bases. I tried to think about the fundamentals, which brought me to some of the earliest roots of our trade: functional programming and higher-order functions (HOF). I discussed some examples of applying higher-order functions in Go recently .

Many of us, software engineers, have experienced those days when nothing really sparks joy in coding, debugging, preparing spikes or refining tasks for the next sprints. Obviously, we would like to have as few of such days as possible and go on with our work effectively. A solution to this definitely is not tormenting our brains with guilt and forced labour. There are other ways, and I would like to invite you to explore them with me and learn a little about our nervous systems in the process.e.

## [Deciding to leave your (executive) job.](https://lethain.com/leaving-the-executive-job/)


If two friendly executives meet for dinner, it’s likely they start by exchanging just how messed up things are at work. Initiatives are behind, layoffs are happening everywhere, the team is in disarray. Then they’ll laugh, and switch topics. Sometimes one of the executives can’t navigate the switch, and will keep ranting throughout their meal. Departing an executive job is much messier than leaving an individual contributor role, and will significantly impact the team and company around you.g.

## [Ergonomic APIs, channel invariants, and data views](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/ergonomic-apis-channel-invariants-and-data-views/)


Hi everyone! It’s two days after the March 20 TLA&#43; workshop, which means it’s time to start getting feedback and revising things for the May 15th workshop . At some point I want to talk about my “workshop technology” I use, but that’ll take some time to write up, so maybe next week? We’ll see. (If you’re on the fence about the workshop: attendees can share specs they write after the class and I give them feedback. Then you can target each constraint against the most efficient representation.

Seven years ago I created a password manager . And a few days ago I pushed out the last release for it, notifying users that nothing else will come now. Yes, with the previous release being from 2019, this might have been obvious. Now it’s official however, PfP: Pain-free Passwords is no longer being developed. I certainly learned a lot from this adventure, and I really like the product which came out of this. This doesn’t mean that PfP is going away. As I said, I was new to cryptography.

The frequency of hazard exposure can sometimes be changed but the processes involved in the system are themselves intrinsically and irreducibly hazardous. Naming conventions in programming Every programmer faces the problem of finding good names to communicate the author’s intent. Most companies buy the idea.

Learning how to manage is a long race - it takes many years and each lap offers new learnings. Along the way, anchors emerge that can help orient a manager when a number of other variables are in flux. Below we offer a number of these anchors. They are based on philosophy, experience, and analysis; we hope they’ll be of some use. 0 - the number of times you should lie Being a manager often means having privileged information. However, some may think that means they must occasionally lie.

Introduction In episode 7, Miki discussed design considerations to keep in mind while creating interfaces in Go with the first idea he proposed being that an interface should represent what we need from a type, and not what is stored on the type. To add some clarity to this thought, Miki explained how the io.Reader and io.Writer interfaces each require one method to be implemented although the underlying concrete type may store more information.

Over the past few years I’ve been writing a lot about innovation, and specifically, the lack thereof in Europe. I also touch on how we’ve outsourced a ton of operational capabilities, leaving us relatively helpless. By now this is such a huge amount of words, audio and video that it is in dire need of a summary, if only to see if it makes any kind of sense taken together.

## [Announcing Outbound Data Transfer Limits](https://blog.replit.com/announcing-outbound-data-transfer-limits)


Beginning April 7th, Replit will begin enforcing limits on the amount of outbound data that developers can transmit from their Repls to users and external services. Inbound data transfer is free. You can see how much outbound data transfer you&#39;ve used on your account page. The meter resets at UTC midnight at the start of every month, and the base limit depends on your plan. Free tier developers will receive 10 GiB, Hacker developers 50 GiB, and Pro developers 100 GiB.10/GiB.com/bounties.

Every week seems to offer fresh staff cuts at the big tech companies right now. Several of the giants are already on their second rounds , and few would probably bet against a third after those. But as hard as it is on an individual level – and it&#39;s always hard! – there&#39;s a silver lining for the economy as a whole: Releasing captive talent. See, the big tech companies gobbled up so much talent at such high salaries during the pandemic that it scarcely left any for the rest of the economy.

The majority of customers will never tell you why they stop buying on their own. In fact, even if pressed, most will just smile, nod, and give you some face-saving reason for how “now is just not the right time” or “we are just going in a different direction”. Because that’s what avoids conflict. Thus, the only time you’re truly allowed a free peek at the naked truth of why your product or service didn’t fit, is when the customer is really upset. That’s when they might air out their frustration.

Last year, we hired a high-profile ad agency to work on our first-ever branding campaign for Basecamp . They were smart, funny... and entirely out of sync with our budget. So we ended up letting them go, hiring a new head of marketing, and doing it all ourselves. The problem was that our entire marketing budget for 2023 amounted to a &#34;mere&#34; five million dollars. Of course this is all on us. But it wasn&#39;t until we saw the proposal for the first video commercial that it really sunk in.

Today&#39;s links Mass tech worker layoffs and the soft landing: Finally, the non-tech sector can hire technical workers. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. &#34;Activist investors&#34; have triggered massive waves of tech layoffs, firing so many tech workers so quickly that it&#39;s hard to even come up with an accurate count. The total is somewhere around 280,000 workers: https://layoffs.fyi/ These layoffs have nothing to do with &#34;trimming the fat&#34; or correcting the hiring excesses of the lockdown.eff.
