In today&#39;s Part II, we&#39;ll examine clues about the real-life identity left behind by &#34;Fearless,&#34; the nickname chosen by the proprietor of the SWAT USA Drops service.

I’m materially finished writing my 3rd book, The Engineering Executive’s Primer . There’s one last chapter to go through tech review, and a fine line editing pass, but the hard stuff is largely done. Of course, that’s an author’s perspective, there is other hard stuff still to be done by other folks in the process, particularly formatting and printing. Each book is an education of sorts, and I decided to work with O’Reilly on this book to push myself on structure and consistency.g.g.g.g.g.

We should all be audience-centric in communication. But, as Julian Treasure contests, we need to take it one step further.  What is the listening I am speaking into? , he says, is the question every speaker should ask themselves over and over. &#34;Every human being’s listening is unique ... we listen through a set of filters and those filters develop as we grow and mature in life and we have experiences. Knowing where the person is coming from, you&#39;ll be able to sense their listening.

This paper from Alibaba group appeared in VLDB&#39;23 . It talks about how to perform low latency strongly-consistent reads from secondaries in PolarDB database deployments. PolarDB adopts the canonical primary secondary architecture of relational databases. The primary is a read-write (RW) node, and the secondaries are read-only (RO) nodes. Having RO nodes help for executing queries, and scaling out in terms of querying performance. This is essentially t he AWS Aurora architecture .e.

The key thing the government is supposed to be able to do is infrastructure. Most of the wealth that we give to the US government no longer goes into that, such that even if you are building decentralized versions, you may be able to outcompete the government. Decentralized stuff is inefficient and harder to build.S.

The groundbreaking Intel 386 processor (1985) was the first 32-bit processor in the x86 line. It has numerous internal registers: general-purpose registers, index registers, segment selectors, and more specialized registers. In this blog post, I look at the silicon die of the 386 and explain how some of these registers are implemented at the transistor level. The registers that I examined are implemented as static RAM, with each bit stored in a common 8-transistor circuit, known as &#34;8T&#34;. (I.e.e.

Hello! While talking with folks about Git, I’ve been seeing a comment over and over to the effect of “I hate rebase”. People seemed to feel pretty strongly about this, and I was really surprised because I don’t run into a lot of problems with rebase and I use it all the time. I’ve found that if many people have a very strong opinion that’s different from mine, usually it’s because they have different experiences around that thing from me. It’s protected from force pushes... Keep it simple.

Rather than saying &#34;bad movie lol&#34;, Big Joel deconstructs The Room and asks the difficult question: what are authors even trying to do? This is a fundamental question that your high-school teachers failed to teach you. While they quizzed you on Symbolism™ and Metaphor™ and Foreshadowing™, they fumbled the underlying lesson: people sometimes make stuff for reasons . Can they understand the cat in Stewart Little ? Dig for authorial intent in Grown Ups 2 . Overanalyze Avatar: The Last Airbender .

Python has a vibrant open source ecosystem and that has been one of the keys to its popularity. As a Python developer, you can create reusable tools and code and easily share them with others. Packaging and publishing your Python code properly enables other developers to easily install and use your code in their own projects. This allows you to contribute back to the community while also building your reputation.append(list1[i]) i &#43;= 1 else : merged_list. See https://pypi.g.g., flask-login).g.1.

We’ll use the same merge sort example code from Part 1 , but package and distribute it with Poetry instead of setuptools. Like in Part 1, we’ll test the package locally, but we’ll also use TestPyPI before publishing to the main package index.

What if you could have a multi-cloud network that was cloud-native, but you didn’t have to know the nitty-gritty details for each of the clouds? That is, you work with a single cloud network interface, and that platform handles the networking so you can focus on things like improving the velocity of application rollouts, architecture, security, and efficiency? Sponsor Prosimo says its platform can do this. On today&#39;s show we look under hood to get details on its multi-cloud networking platform.

## [Overcoming leakage on error-corrected quantum processors](http://blog.research.google/2023/11/overcoming-leakage-on-error-corrected.html)


Posted by Kevin Miao and Matt McEwen, Research Scientists, Quantum AI Team The qubits that make up Google quantum devices are delicate and noisy, so it’s necessary to incorporate error correction procedures that identify and account for qubit errors on the way to building a useful quantum computer. Two of the most prevalent error mechanisms are bit-flip errors (where the energy state of the qubit changes) and phase-flip errors (where the phase of the encoded quantum information changes).

Posted by Xin Wang, Software Engineer, and Nishanth Dikkala, Research Scientist, Google Research Contemporary deep learning models have been remarkably successful in many domains, ranging from natural language to computer vision. Moreover, they form the backbone of all the current state-of-the-art language models . Increasing scale in Transformer networks has led to improved performance and the emergence of behavior not present in smaller networks.g. Latency is measured on TPUv3 with 8 cores.e.

Posted by Sara Ahmadian and Mehran Kazemi, Research Scientists, Google Research Clustering is a fundamental, ubiquitous problem in data mining and unsupervised machine learning, where the goal is to group together similar items. The standard forms of clustering are metric clustering and graph clustering. In metric clustering, a given metric space defines distances between data points, which are grouped together based on their separation . quality dilemma.e.e.e. See the paper for more details.

How Neural Networks “Learn” Photo by Rohit Tandon /  Unsplash Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are universal function approximators . They can approximate any complex function if provided with enough data, have a proper architecture, and are trained for enough time. In this post, I’m going to describe the algorithm of gradient descent, which is used to adjust the weights of an ANN. Let’s start with the basic concepts. Not a nice scenario, but it shows the “boundaries” of the problem.4.........

A crucial method in binary outcome analysis Image by Issac Smith on  Unsplash Whenever we face any task related to analyzing binary outcomes, we often think of logistic regression as the go-to method. That’s why most articles about binary outcome regression focus exclusively on logistic regression. However, logistic regression is not the only option available. There are other methods, such as the Linear Probability Model (LPM), Probit regression, and Complementary Log-Log (Cloglog) regression.e.
