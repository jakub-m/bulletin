Many people want to advance in their careers. It’s natural to seek career progression and the increased compensation and autonomy that typically come with it (although of course it’s also more than fine to remain in a role that you enjoy for the long term). This post runs through some of the most important dimensions for being a senior leader that I personally aim for, and that I look for when promoting or hiring senior management. Your team needs to be self-scaling and self-replicating.

## [ Hekaton: SQL Server’s Memory-Optimized OLTP Engine](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/08/hekaton-sql-servers-memory-optimized.html)


This paper (Sigmod 2013) gives an overview of the design of the Hekaton engine which is optimized for memory resident data and OLTP workloads and is fully integrated into Microsoft SQL Server. The paper starts with a strongly opinionated paragraph: SQL Server and other major database management systems were designed assuming that main memory is expensive and data resides on disk. I really like this paper. The paper is self-contained and is easy to follow. It is very well written.g.8X.3X.7X.

As we’ve seen in the previous article , a browser extension isn’t very different from a website. It’s all the same HTML pages and JavaScript code. The code executes in the browser’s regular sandbox. So what can websites possibly gain by exploiting vulnerabilities in a browser extension? Well, access to extension privileges of course. Browser extensions usually have lots of those, typically explicitly defined in the permissions entry of the extension manifest, but some are granted implicitly.g.g.

When you’re working in an environment with strict compliance needs, you want to make sure you’re following the principle of least privilege and granting employees access only to the resources they need to do their job. Tailscale ACLs already make that possible by letting you define what someone can access — and restricting their access to everything else — with “default deny” rules . That’s where Opal comes in. Add the Tailscale app to Opal following the documentation .

Port forwarding is the practice of directing data traffic from the outside world to access a device or network within your private system. In other words, it facilitates a service in a private network to connect with other public or private network services or systems. One classic example of port forwarding is the automated telephony system, IVR (Interactive Voice Response). In this case, you are an outside system attempting to access a customer service agent within an organization.

Cloud misconfigurations are estimated to account for over 99% of breaches by 2025, according to Gartner . We have already witnessed some of the biggest attacks that have affected untold numbers of organizations over the last couple of years. Solarwinds is likely the most notable example.

There were a couple of threads this week on why Test Driven Development, or TDD, isn’t more widely used by programmers. I spoze the historic and ongoing inability/unwillingness of the software trade to grasp and adopt test-driven development (TDD) is one of the most frustrating &amp; demoralizing events of my forty-two years as a professional geek. I have a different explanation: TDD isn’t as valuable as its strongest proponents believe. I defended it back in 2018 and would defend it now.  ↩

However, robotic systems today are capable of executing only very short, hard-coded commands , such as “Pick up an apple,” because they tend to perform best with clear tasks and rewards. We are also excited to release a robot simulation setup where the research community can test this approach.e.e.g.

Single pair Ethernet. That’s right. Ethernet over a single twisted pair, rather than the four you’re used to. Or two if you’ve got a little gray in your beard. Now, single pair Ethernet isn’t fast in the way we network engineers would normally think of fast. SPE runs at 10 megabits per second. But in the use cases SPE was designed for, 10Mbps is very fast indeed. To tell us all about single pair Ethernet is Peter Jones.

Why are so many companies moving to the cloud? One reason we hear quite often is cost reduction. The elasticity of cloud services, or its ability to scale up or down as needed, means paying only for what you use. Right up there on the list of reasons is security. This is because developing in the cloud enables greater visibility and governance over your deployment&#39;s resources and data. Constantly tuning your deployment can quickly become tedious work due to the sheer magnitude of options.

## [Simplify model serving with custom prediction routines on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/simplify-model-serving-custom-prediction-routines-vertex-ai/)


The data received at serving time is rarely in the format your model expects. Numerical columns need to be normalized, features created, image bytes decoded, input values validated. Transforming the data can be as important as the prediction itself. That’s why we’re excited to announce custom prediction routines on Vertex AI, which simplify the process of writing pre and post processing code. You can see an example here  showing how to build a model server with FastAPI.cloud.aiplatform.cloud.

## [How autonomic data security can help define cloud’s future](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/clouds-future-points-to-autonomic-data-security/)


“Ninety percent of all data today was created in the last two years—that’s 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day,” according to business data analytics company Domo . That would be a mind-bending statistic, except that it’s already five years old.  As data usage has undergone drastic expansion and changes in the past five years, so have your business needs for data. Technology such as cloud computing and AI have changed how we use data, derive value from data, and glean insights from data...

## [Best practices of migrating Hive ACID Tables to BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/apache-hive-to-bigquery/)


Are you looking to migrate a large amount of Hive ACID tables to BigQuery?  ACID enabled Hive tables support transactions that accept updates and delete DML operations. In this blog, we will explore migrating Hive ACID tables to BigQuery. The approach explored in this blog works for both compacted (major / minor) and non-compacted Hive tables. Let’s first understand the term ACID and how it works in Hive. Underlying the Hive ACID table, files are in the ORC ACID version.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.
