The Dirty Work Theory: The lamentable work that many people avoid are great places to look for high impact, low hanging fruit. Whenever people ask me for advice on career growth, I share what has worked reasonably well for me: find a growth company, one that really needs you to get work done, and then tackle the unpleasant work that everyone avoids. When growth is high you also win by doing, rather than winning by getting ahead politically. Think of joining Coinbase pre-layoffs..etc.

She muted her arguments when we were considering whether to have any children because she wanted to give me a free choice about my life’s wide arc. But now that we have one child our lifetype is set, and discussions about more are just debates about parameters. Gaby loved being pregnant with Oscar. It’s not possible.

Hello! When I was writing the zine How DNS Works earlier this year, someone asked me – why do people sometimes put a dot at the end of a domain name? For example, if you look up the IP for example.com by running dig example.com , you’ll see this: $ dig example.com example.com. 5678 IN A 93.184.216.34 dig has put a . to the end of example.com – now it’s example.com. ! What’s up with that? Also, some DNS tools require domains to have a &#34;.&#34; at the end: if you try to pass example.Msg) m.com&#34;, dns.2.

## [  Memory-Optimized Multi-Version Concurrency Control for Disk-Based Database Systems](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/09/memory-optimized-multi-version.html)


This paper is from VLDB 2022. It takes the MVCC system developed in Hyper and adopts it to a memory-optimized disk-based (not the spinning type, SSDs really) database system so that the system can handle a very large database that won&#39;t fit in RAM while achieving very high performance.  Motivation and introduction As in-memory databases were conceived, it was assumed that main memory sizes would rise in accord with the amount of data in need of processing.e.g.e.4 GHz.2 × over PostgreSQL, 27.

 Proof using the limit definition As a prerequisite for this proof, let&#39;s reorder the original definition of e slightly. If we perform a change of variable replacing n by \frac{1}{m} , we get: \[e=\displaystyle \lim_{m \to 0}\left ( 1&#43;m \right )^\frac{1}{m} \tag{1}\] This equation will become useful a bit later. The way out - as is often the case in such scenarios - is a sneaky change of variable. Note that as h approaches zero, so does m .

So I interviewed 6 Bazel experts 1 and asked them what they like about Bazel, when they would use it, and what to expect or consider before doing a Bazel migration. It’s a long read, and I promise, it’s worth it.

With widespread adoption of cloud-based, 24x7 environments available from all time zones, every hour of the day, easy-to-find deployment windows are gone.
