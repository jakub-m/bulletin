(Feeling a little sick so this one will be short.) I&#39;m often asked by clients to review their (usually TLA&#43;) formal specifications. These specs are generally slower and more convoluted than an expert would write. I want to fix them up without changing the overall behavior of the spec or introducing subtle bugs. To do this, I use a rather lovely feature of TLA&#43;. Say I see a 100-line Foo action that I think I can refactor down to 20 lines. This should catch a bad refactor via failing tests.....  ↩

If I could only popularize one idea about technical strategy, it would be that prematurely applying pressure to a strategy’s rollout prevents evaluating whether the strategy is effective. Pressure changes behavior in profound ways, and many of those changes are intended to make you believe your strategy is working while minimizing change to the status quo (if you’re an executive) or get your strategy repealed (if you’re not an executive). Neither is particular helpful.g.g.

Ferroelectric memory (FRAM) is an interesting storage technique that stores bits in a special &#34;ferroelectric&#34; material. Ferroelectric memory is nonvolatile like flash memory, able to hold its data for decades. But, unlike flash, ferroelectric memory can write data rapidly. Moreover, FRAM is much more durable than flash and can be be written trillions of times. With these advantages, you might wonder why FRAM isn&#39;t more popular.

I wrote last month that what you want to do is one of the most useful motivations in life. I want to follow that up by saying that the only thing more important than wanting to do something is to actually do something. The most valuable trait you can develop for yourself is to be consistent. It is absolutely something you can develop. And moreover it&#39;s kind of hard to believe that for anyone it is innate. I meet so many people who say they want to do things. This is completely understandable.

Chapter 6 of the Designing Data Intensive Applications (DDIA) book discusses partitioning, a key technique for scaling large datasets and high query throughput in distributed databases. By breaking data into smaller partitions, it can be distributed across multiple nodes in a shared-nothing cluster. This allows the storage and processing load to be spread across many disks and processors. Partitioning of Key-Value Data There are two main approaches to partitioning key-value data.4.

The trend is moving towards virtualization and cloud-native architectures. Return flights suck the most.

Walter targets web applications that operate across multiple geographic sites, and it aims to balance consistency and latency in such systems by providing strong consistency within a site, and weaker consistency across sites. Parallel Snapshot Isolation (PSI) The paper introduces a new isolation property called Parallel Snapshot Isolation (PSI). Preferred site does not mean a primary site, it is more flexible.

Wow, what a week that was! The two days of HPTS (Monday and Tuesday this week) felt like a week to me. I learned a lot, and had a lot of good conversations, and even was able to squeeze in some beach walks in there.  HPTS has been operating since 1985, convenening mostly every two years. It has been described as Davos for database systems. Pat Helland has been running HPTS since 1989, and as usual he kicked it off with some short opening remarks 8:30am Monday morning. &#34;HPTS is about the breaks.
