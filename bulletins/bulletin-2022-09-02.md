It’s also a rewrite and expansion of one of my very first newsletters: on emulation . I find myself fascinating with terms. Take, for example, “side effect”. A side effect is when a function changes the outside world in addition to computing a value.

In the article discussing the attack surface of extension pages I said: Websites, malicious or not, cannot usually access extension pages directly however. And then I proceeded talking about extension pages as if this security mechanism were always in place. But that isn’t the case of course, and extensions will quite often disable it at least partially. The impact of extension pages being exposed to the web is severe and warrants a thorough discussion in a separate article. So here it comes.4.

Posted Grigor Aslanyan, Software Engineer, Google Patent documents typically use legal and highly technical language, with context-dependent terms that may have meanings quite different from colloquial usage and even between different documents. The process of using traditional patent search methods (e.g., keyword searching) to search through the corpus of over one hundred million patent documents can be tedious and result in many missed results due to the broad and non-standard language used.g.

## [Write-ahead logging and the ARIES crash recovery algorithm](https://sookocheff.com/post/databases/write-ahead-logging/)


A central tenet of databases is that any committed data survives a crash or a failure. Write-ahead logging is a fundamental primitive that ensures all changes to data are first written safely to stable storage before being applied. Coupling that with some careful use of sequence numbers and we can guarantee that changes made to a database can survive system crashes. Motivation Let’s start with a simple transaction T1 that reads object A, and updates the value for A with a write.

This paper (Sigmod 2019) presents Socrates, the database-as-a-service (DBaaS) architecture of the  Azure SQL DB Hyperscale. Deploying a DBaaS in the cloud requires an architecture that is cost-effective yet performant. An idea that works well is to decompose/disaggregate the functionality of a database into two as compute services (e.g., transaction processing) and storage services (e.g., checkpointing and recovery). The first commercial system that adopted this idea is Amazon Aurora.e.g.g.e.

Hello! I’ve been working on writing a zine about debugging for a while (here’s an early draft of the table of contents ). As part of that I thought it might be fun to read some academic papers about debugging, and last week Greg Wilson sent me some papers about academic research into debugging. One of those papers ( Towards a framework for teaching debugging [paywalled] ) had a categorization I really liked of the different kinds of knowledge/skills we need to debug effectively. 2. 3. 4. 5.

“There’s no difference between the physiological response to something that you’re excited about and something that you’re nervous about or dreading,” says Andrew Huberman associate professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford University. In this “Best of” episode, we revisit one of our most popular interviews. “If people can conceptualize that the anxiety or stress response is the same as the excitement response, they feel different,” Huberman says.

I was getting my car&#39;s oil changed recently, when the mechanic&#39;s phone in the office buzzed. He walked over, picked it up, looked at the screen, and said, &#34;Yeah, right.&#34; He then showed me the text message. Someone had recently won the lottery and decided to share the winnings with a few random people -- and the mechanic&#39;s phone was &#34;chosen at random&#34;. The mechanic immediately recognized it as a scam. Best of all: he took his phone out to the garage and showed it to the other employees.twimg...g.

A week ago, I finally got round to implementing an idea I’d been toying with for years: what if your computer made a little bit of noise every time it sent data to Google? From studying logs, I’d long known just how many sites send all your visits and clicks to (at least) Google, but a log that you have to manually create first and then analyze is not very dramatic.

When Uber Engineering reached 800 engineers, engineering was divided across roughly five engineering directors. Most engineering and process issues were resolved locally within these five organizations. This worked well for the most part, but meant there was little consistency within our core processes. Hiring was particularly fragmented, with every team’s manager responsible for developing their own interviews, questions and structure.g.g. As with all things, your mileage may well vary.

Sometimes it will be tough, but within the normal realm of expectations: we missed on some of our goals, and are going to freeze hiring. Sometimes the bad news is terrible: we lost a huge customer, our runway is running out, and we’re going to have to lay off 20% of the company. Keep this section as brief as possible. Good luck.

In this episode, we’ll be further exploring PRs. Check out The art of the PR: Part 1 if you haven’t yet. What is it that makes a PR a good PR? How do you consider PRs in an open source repo? How do you vet contributions from people who aren’t a part of the repository? How does giving feedback and encouragement fit in to the PR process? We’ll be debating the details, and trying to help our fellow gophers perfect the art of the PR.

Security is often seen as a zero-sum game between “go fast” or “stay secure.” We would like to challenge this school of thought and introduce a framework to change that paradigm to a “win-win game,” so you can do both—“go fast” and “stay secure.”  Historically, application security tools have been implemented much like a gate at a parking lot. The parking lot has perimeter-based ingress and egress boom gates. However, there are few controls once you get inside. Instead, this is what we need.

Most data analysts are familiar with the concept of organizing data into clusters so that it can be queried faster and at a lower cost. The user behavior dictates how the dataset should be clustered: for example, when a user seeks to analyze or visualize geospatial data (a.k.a location data), it is most efficient to cluster on a geospatial column.  BigQuery is a petabyte-scale data warehouse that has many geospatial capabilities and functions .
