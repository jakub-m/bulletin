Best of all, it can accommodate all the tools you already use. The Trouble with Kubernetes Kubernetes is hard, even for the most knowledgeable staff. Dealing with a new and complex platform can also lead to security vulnerabilities, due to the scope for misconfiguration.

I recently switched from VirtualBox to KVM for my virtualization needs. While this approach has clear advantages such as not requiring custom kernel drivers, the downside is that snapshots aren’t currently supported for Windows 11. And since I don’t want applications I analyze to corrupt my main Windows VM, I decided that I should run these in freshly created Windows VMs. The issue with this approach is: setting up a new Windows VM is fairly time-consuming.iso .xml file and any scripts required.

At LinkedIn, we have traditionally maintained our source code in large, monolithic repositories (repos). While this worked for over a decade, it proved challenging to maintain and support as our repo grew larger, and issues like long build times, difficulties managing merge queues for reverts, and slow deployments led to differing levels of frustration for our developers.

A few months ago I was poking around the package contents of Tailscale’s macOS app when I happened to notice that the main Tailscale binary was surprisingly large — more than 37 megabytes. Some of the size is explained by it being a universal app — it includes both x86_64 (for Intel-based Macs) and arm64 slices (for Apple silicon ones). However, even when accounting for that, it seemed too large for what is mostly a UI wrapper — the core logic lives in a network extension .5 MB). 24 MB. main ...

Natural language is often frustratingly ambiguous. There are scenarios where ambiguity is useful. For example, in diplomacy, the ambiguity of a statement can provide wiggle room so that the parties can both claim that they agree on a statement, while simultaneously disagreeing on what the statement actually means. (Mind you, this difference in interpretation might … Continue reading The high cost of low ambiguity →

It was using a car scenario for an example, and it went something like this: The car didn&#39;t start... because the battery is dead... because the alternator wasn&#39;t charging it... because the alternator belt broke... because the belt was beyond its useful life but wasn&#39;t replaced... because it wasn&#39;t maintained according to recommended schedule.

## [Writing Javascript without a build system](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/16/writing-javascript-without-a-build-system/)


Hello! I’ve been writing some Javascript this week, and as always when I start a new frontend project, I was faced with the question: should I use a build system? I want to talk about what’s appealing to me about build systems, why I (usually) still don’t use them, and why I find it frustrating that some frontend Javascript libraries require that you use a build system. I can just have one 400-line script.js file and call it a day. I last edited that project 2 years ago, on a different machine..

Podekscytowałem się demem nowego Binga , porównałem je nawet do demo iPhone i Steva Jobsa i nazwałem rewolucją. Wydawało mi się, że dość dokładnie je obejrzałem. Jednak nie na tyle dokładnie, żeby sprawdzić czy informacje, które GPT wypluwa podczas demo, są prawdziwe. GPT ma skłonność do halucynacji. GPT odpowiada na pytanie, nawet jeśli nie zna poprawnej odpowiedzi. Po prostu “wymyśla” odpowiedź. Taka wymyślona odpowiedź to halucynacja. To jest zabawne, bo znam prawdziwą odpowiedź.

Nie miałem możliwości przetestowania tego jak nowy Bing działa w praktyce, zapisałem się na listę oczekujących, jeszcze mnie nie wpuszczono, opieram więc swoje opinie na demo z oficjalnej prezentacji. Układ demo przypomina słynne demo iPhone od Steva Jobsa . Składa się z 4 sekcji z których pierwsza jest od razu pominięta (?). Pierwsze dwa wszyscy od razu rozumieli. Wyniki mają przypisy.

With the right mindset, and considering your program’s actual formatting needs, it’s not as difficult as it might appear.

But it was realizing that email is the true center of the CRM that paved the path toward a real product. Only, we didn&#39;t build the CRM part before we released HEY! That&#39;s changing now.

You can’t just say you’ll do it later. Later, you won’t be pumped up about it anymore.  If you’re inspired on a Friday, swear off the weekend and dive into the project. But it won’t wait for you.

You know you&#39;re old when you can talk about stuff that happened twenty years ago with vivid recollection. I&#39;m now that old. This week, it&#39;s been 19 years(!!) since we first launched Basecamp . Which means it&#39;s been well over twenty years that I&#39;ve been working with Jason Fried at 37signals, and also more than twenty years since I first picked up the Ruby programming language. No it doesn&#39;t. Most of the time, it&#39;s incremental improvement on enduring ideas. I&#39;m just zooming out a bit here.

Tim McNamara is known as New Zealand’s Rust guy. He is the author of Rust in Action, and also a Senior Software Engineer at AWS, where he helps other builders with all things Rust. The main reason why Gerhard is intrigued by Rust is the incredible resource frugality. Fewer CPUs means less energy used, which is good for the planet, and good for the monthly bill. This becomes most noticeable at Amazon’s scale, when S3, Lambda, CloudFront and other services start adding Rust components.
