The attack on Ukraine has shocked the entire world, but in Poland it is making especially big waves. Not just due to geographical proximity - Ukrainians are one of the largest minorities in Poland and simply put it is affecting people we know personally. While the fighting continues, here’s what Allegro is doing, and what you can do, too, to help humanitarian efforts. If you know any Ukrainians, your coworkers in particular, talk to them and show your support. Even minor gestures are important.

Fixing retries with token buckets and circuit breakers Throttle yourself before you DoS yourself. After my last post on circuit breakers , a couple of people reached out to recommend using circuit breakers only to break retries, and still send normal first try traffic no matter the failure rate. That&#39;s a nice approach. To see how well that works, we can compare it to my favorite better retries approach: a token bucket. First, let&#39;s formally introduce the players: No retries . N retries .

There were two unrelated things that really caused February to be busy: Chinese screenshots and war in Ukraine. (That&#39;s 27 out of 30 pictures... he&#39;s right.

## [You can Turn the Oven Down](https://tomgamon.com/posts/turn-the-oven-down/)


The other day I was cooking something in the oven. It was browning too quickly on top so I was juggling it between shelves and covering it with foil. My partner came in and said “Why don’t you turn the oven down?” I was treating something that is variable as invariable. There is an infamous project within my team where we were running behind and tensions were high. We had a particularly fractious meeting and my manager at the time stepped in. Recently I was helping some engineers in the team.

Posted by Abhishek Kumar and Ehsan Amid, Research Scientists, Google Research, Brain Team Over the past several years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been quite successful in driving impressive performance gains in several real-world applications, from image recognition to genomics . However, modern DNNs often have far more trainable model parameters than the number of training examples and the resulting overparameterized networks can easily overfit to noisy or corrupted labels (i.e.g.e.e.8.

Testing helps you discover bugs before you release software, enabling you to deliver a high-quality product to your customers. Sometimes, though, tests are flaky and unreliable. What is a flaky test? Flaky tests, also known as flappers, fail to produce accurate and consistent results. These tests may be unreliable because of newly-written code or as a result of external factors. If your tests are flaky, they cannot help you find (and fix) all your bugs, which negatively impacts user experience.
