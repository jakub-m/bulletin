## [Mounting git commits as folders with NFS](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/12/04/mounting-git-commits-as-folders-with-nfs/)


Hello! The other day, I started wondering – has anyone ever made a FUSE filesystem for a git repository where all every commit is a folder? It turns out the answer is yes! There’s giblefs , GitMounter , and git9 for Plan 9. But FUSE is pretty annoying to use on Mac – you need to install a kernel extension, and Mac OS seems to be making it harder and harder to install kernel extensions for security reasons. Also I had a few ideas for how to organize the filesystem differently than those projects.

## [What is eBPF and Why is it Important?](https://sookocheff.com/post/ebpf/what-is-ebpf-and-why-is-it-important/)


A short tagline from the book Learning eBPF describes eBPF as a revolutionary kernel technology that allows developers to write custom code that can be loaded into the kernel dynamically, changing the way the kernel behaves. The key word in this phrase is dynamically. eBPF allows you to write custom code that changes the way the kernel behaves without having to implement a kernel module or integrate your code directly into the kernel.

The Intel 386 processor (1985) was a large step from the 286 processor, moving x86 to a 32-bit architecture. The 386 also dramatically improved the performance of shift and rotate operations by adding a &#34;barrel shifter&#34;, a circuit that can shift by multiple bits in one step. The die photo below shows the 386&#39;s barrel shifter, highlighted in the lower left and taking up a substantial part of the die. The 386 die with the main functional blocks labeled.

## [Making Decisions: First decide how to decide: “one weird trick” for easier decisions](https://jacobian.org/2023/dec/5/how-to-decide/)


This is my preferred decision-making process – a version of the “document-discuss-decide” process that I called for at the end of the part 1 in this series. The most important part of this process – its “one weird trick”, if you will – is the way it includes a “how shall we decide?” step. This separates out the meta-question of the decision-making process from the decision itself, which (I’ve found) makes decisions much easier.

## [Practical Ways To Increase Product Velocity](https://staysaasy.com/management/2023/12/07/accelerating-product-velocity.html)


Speed determines victory for technology companies. Since the internet was invented, the fast have killed the slow. And out of all the ways that speed matters, product velocity – the pace at which you evolve your product – matters most of all. But improving product velocity is hard. It’s common to view velocity as an engineering consideration, but a modern cross-functional team’s velocity is just as influenced by product management, design, or even sales and marketing. It’s rarely a secret.

Tailscale assigns every one of your nodes a private IPv4 address. We do this from the CGNAT range, which is typically used by ISPs that have run out of public IPv4 addresses. Starting today, you have control over what IP address from that range is assigned to your nodes. This gives you the ability to decide what subset of the CGNAT range your tailnet uses to avoid conflicts with other applications.

There are very few universal rules in software engineering, but there are are a lot of near -universal principles. Things like &#34;prefer composition to inheritance&#34; is near-universal. I love finding the rare situations where these principles don&#39;t hold, like where you do want inheritance over composition . A similar near-universal principle is &#34;don&#39;t use bubblesort &#34;. 1 But Knuth&#39;s been wrong before , so let&#39;s see if this universal rule is only near -universal. Bubble sort works pretty well here .

Platform engineering is key to today&#39;s cloud-native world, as it ushers DevOps into a new era. The discipline revolves around an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), a unified toolset covering every operational need from coding to deployment. The focus here is to lessen cognitive friction for developers while giving operations a structured way to manage technology. With platform engineering, this operational efficiency is no longer a distant aspiration, but a milestone within reach.

Occasionally folks tell me that I should “write full time.” I’ve thought about this a lot, and have rejected that option because I believe that writers who operate (e.g. write concurrently with holding a non-writing industry role) are best positioned to keep writing valuable work that advances the industry. This is a lightly controversial view, so I wanted to pull together my full set of thoughts on the topic.g.g.g.g. Operating is, for me, remaining accountable for what I write.g.g.g.g.

Over the last few years, what I’ve come to appreciate is that there’s another phase: purpose. In my “2023 year in review” post , I mentioned the idea of “advancing the industry.
