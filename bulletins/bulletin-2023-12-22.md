When my children were little and I was trying to figure out how to be a parent, I read someplace that you need to have five positive interactions with your child for each negative one to maintain a good relationship. I don&#39;t know whether that is fact or myth; a quick Google search suggests that the origin of the idea was in a study about how married couples argue, the idea being that in a good marriage, positive things continue to happen even amidst disagreement.

## [So you want custom allocator support in your C library](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/12/17/)


Users of mature C libraries conventionally get to choose how memory is allocated — that is, when it cannot be avoided entirely . The C standard never laid down a convention — perhaps for the better — so each library re-invents an allocator interface. Not all are created equal, and most repeat a few fundamental mistakes. Often the interface is merely a token effort, to check off that it’s “supported” without actual consideration to its use. The “realloc” function accepts both old and new size...

Someone recently asked me if I had advice for early-career programmers. At first I thought this was a silly question. I only entered the workforce ten years ago; many of my newsletter subscribers have been programming for longer than I&#39;ve been alive! Then I went and read some &#34;advice for starting programmer&#34; essays and thought of some things they missed. So here&#39;s thirteen bits of advice for early-career programmers. Some of it is contradictory. Try not to hold it against them later. Take walks.

Nezha (VLDB&#39;23) is a consensus protocol that leverages synchronized clocks to decrease latency and increase throughput. There is also a GitHub repo for the implementation of Nezha and TLA&#43; model associated with the protocol. Nezha&#39;s approach is to offload the traditional leader or sequencer-based ordering to synchronized clocks, achieving decentralized coordination without the need to rely on network routers or sequencers. And then there is a slow-path that covers for the case where that fails.

For example, if someone deals you five cards from a well-shuffled deck, and you want to know the odds of getting a royal flush, we can answer that question precisely. At least, we can if you are clearly referring to just this one hand. But if you’ve been playing poker regularly for a decade and then one... Read More Read More

Observability is often defined in the context of three pillars - logs, metrics, and traces. Modern-day cloud-native applications are complex and dynamic. To avoid surprises and performance issues, you need a robust observability stack. But is observability limited to collecting logs, metrics, and traces?...

## [Notes on How Big Things Get Done](https://lethain.com/notes-on-how-big-things-get-done/)


How Big Things Get Done by Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner is a fascinating look at why some megaprojects fail so resoundingly and why others succeed under budget and under schedule. It’s an exploration of planning methods, the role of expertise, the value of benchmarking similar projects, and much more. Not directly software engineering related, but very relevant to the work. Also, just well written. “Think slow, act fast” It’s fine for planning to be slow (p17), as long as delivery is fast.

While repairing an eight-inch HP floppy drive, we found that the problem was a broken interface chip. Since the chip was bad, I decapped it and took photos. This chip is very unusual: instead of a silicon substrate, the chip is formed on a base of sapphire, with silicon and metal wiring on top. As a result, the chip is transparent as you can see from the gold &#34;X&#34; visible through the die in the photo below. The PHI die as seen through an inspection microscope.

Intel&#39;s 386 processor (1985) was an important advance in the x86 architecture, not only moving to a 32-bit processor but also switching to a CMOS implementation. I&#39;ve been reverse-engineering parts of the 386 chip and came across two interesting and completely different circuits that the 386 uses to implement an XOR gate: one uses standard-cell logic while the other uses pass-transistor logic. In this article, I take a look at those circuits. The die of the 386. Structure of a MOS transistor.

## [GitHub x Replit Workflows: Enhancing Developer Productivity](https://blog.replit.com/github)


As developers, we constantly seek tools that simplify our workflows and boost our productivity. We know that most code lives on GitHub, so we want to make running, maintaining, collaborating on, and deploying code from GitHub repositories effortless. Previously, importing a GitHub repository into Replit was a subpar experience. Finding the correct repository was time-consuming due to the lack of owner-based grouping and detailed repository information.

Integrating the latest AI tools into your team can be a significant advantage. However, assessing these tools and setting them up to run can take time and effort. Whether you’re testing a new large language model or building a prototype with a vector database, chances are somebody has already developed a similar AI tool. Fork one of the AI templates below and customize it for your requirements. 1. Gemini vs GPT-4 Easily integrate and compare the two top-performing LLMs with this starter code.

## [Updates to Social Features on Replit](https://blog.replit.com/social-updates)


In 2024, we&#39;re excited to introduce improvements to our social features on Replit, all centered around making it easier to share and explore code. We learned from our top creators that a cover page&#39;s primary value is sharing code and giving other developers something to fork. Additionally, we recognized that viewing applications in an iframe is a suboptimal experience. Often, missing Secrets prevented the program from running as intended.

If you’ve ever tried to install a complex Python package, you know the pain of scouring the package’s README for the apt install or brew install commands necessary to bring in the system-level dependencies the package needs. This approach can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially when a cascade of errors indicates a missing system dependency — a pain point that isn&#39;t always immediately obvious. You can now skip the README and let us install everything for you.nix file.

I swear the intention isn’t to constantly start fights with guardians of every sacred paradigm in the tech world. To be honest, it’s been a bit exhausting at times to concurrently argue on at least three major flanks. But that’s just how this year has turned out, given the work we’ve been pursuing. Because intellectual arguments can always be countered in the abstract realm of the debate. But shipping proof isn’t so easily refuted by clever rhetoric or calls to authority. I highly recommend it.

The dream has come true. It’s now possible to build fast, modern web applications without transpiling or bundling either JavaScript or CSS. I’ve been working towards this personal nirvana ever since we begrudgingly started transpiling and bundling assets in the late 2000s. Browsers just weren’t good enough back then to avoid it. But they are now. Here’s a chart of the 68 individual JavaScript files that we load in ONCE #1 via import maps. The waterfall is vertical. Now it’s possible. Yes.

But it’s only by looking back at the work from a distance that you can really appreciate it. So allow me to do that here. To appreciate the banner year of programming productivity that was 2023 at our company. In the sense that we don’t make money from open source. None of that stuff. No more, no less.

The mission was set! A month later, we placed an order for $600,000 worth of Dell servers to carry our exit, and did the math to conservatively estimate $7 million in savings over the next five years .

I continue to see new B2B software startups struggle with native mobile apps. Consumer software makers can usually start by going all-in on a single platform, but for business tools, that’s rarely an option. So they must face the tall task of tackling web, iOS, and Android at the same time. Hence the proliferation of toolkits like React Native, Turbo Native , and a hundred other frameworks vying to ease the pain. But it still hurts. The problem space is just too large. I hate that.e. But it is.

## [From Cleaning Offices to Designing EV Charging Stations](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-hardware-engineer-greta-bekeryte)


Greta Bekerytė started out cleaning offices and ended up designing electronics for EV charging stations. It’s amazing what you can accomplish in your career when you follow your dreams. It wasn’t easy. Bekerytė moved from her native Lithuania to Norway in 2010 to take advantage of the country’s free university tuition, but first she had to find a way to support herself. It took her four years, but she was finally able to afford the tuition for the language courses, which cost thousands of U.S.”

## [IBM Demos Transistor With Liquid Nitrogen Cooling](https://spectrum.ieee.org/nanosheet-transistor)


Liquid nitrogen boils at just 77 kelvins (-196 °C). Cooling electronics to this frigid temperature could boost performance, but today’s transistors aren’t designed with cryogenic temperatures in mind. At the 2023 IEEE International Electron Device Meeting (IEDM) held in San Francisco earlier in December, IBM researchers demonstrated the first advanced CMOS transistor optimized for liquid-nitrogen cooling. Combined with lower power, devices can drive a higher current at a given voltage.

Last January, in the waters off Cebu City in the Philippines, researchers first deployed a huge flexible ring seeded with seaweed and spanned by spokelike ropes and tubes. Every nightfall, cranks mounted on a floating platform lower the ring 25 meters below the surface to expose the seaweed to cooler, more nutrient-rich water. At daybreak, the cranks pull the ring back up to the surface to soak up sunlight and carbon dioxide. This article is part of our special report Top Tech 2024 .D.”

OLED displays dominate cellphones and have grabbed a big piece of the high-end TV market, thanks to their crisp images, deep black levels, and wide viewing angles. But OLED technology doesn’t do better than the alternative—LCDs—in longevity or brightness. And energy efficiency is a toss-up, depending on the images being displayed. This year, OLED will get a big boost in all three of those metrics, when blue phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED) materials become commercially available. Fluorescent vs.”

For the past five years, Intel has lagged behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung in advanced chip manufacturing. Now, in an attempt to regain the lead, the company is making a bold—and risky—move, introducing two novel technologies in its desktop and laptop Arrow Lake processor, due out in late 2024. Intel hopes to leapfrog its competitors with new transistor technology and a power-delivery system that would be the first of its kind. “There’s a lot riding on this.”

Using the brain to directly control an object was long the stuff of science fiction, and in 1988 the vision became a reality. IEEE Life Senior Member Stevo Bozinovski and Members Mihail Sestakov and Dr. Liljana Bozinovska used a student volunteer’s electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals to move a robot along a closed-circuit track. Bozinovski and Sestakov were electrical engineering and computer science professors at Saints Cyril and Methodius University , in Skopje, North Macedonia.
