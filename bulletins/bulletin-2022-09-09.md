A 21-year-old New Jersey man has been arrested and charged with stalking in connection with a federal investigation into groups of cybercriminals who are settling scores by hiring people to carry out physical attacks on their rivals. Prosecutors say the defendant recently participated in several of these schemes -- including firing a handgun into a Pennsylvania home and torching a residence in another part of the state with a Molotov Cocktail.

The goal was to get 100% of our manually-written documentation converted to Markdown, and we really had a mountain of source code to climb for this particular expedition. In this post, we’ll describe why we decided to migrate to Markdown, and the steps you can take that will help us on our mission.

In the world of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), change tends to happen very slowly and cautiously. It is therefore quite exciting how many new features Galileo, the “European GPS” has been rolling out lately. Earlier I wrote a little bit about the High Accuracy Service (HAS), whereby the Galileo satellites themselves provide properly equipped receivers (not your phone) with near-realtime updates that can be used to achieve very good accuracy.

Before asking the question, how do I build AGI, you first must ask the question, what would I recognize as AGI? I suspect there’s not a “real” answer for this. Humans can be fooled both ways, into thinking simple things have “intelligence” and “life”, and into thinking complex things don’t. Though they usually aren’t fooled for too long, at least with the simple things. I define AGI as a machine capable of taking (almost) any human job . This says a few things about what it must be like.ai .

## [​6 Key Ideas Shaping GitOps Today](https://www.weave.works/blog/-6-ideas-shaping-gitops)


GitOps has already established itself as the most promising standard for Continuous Delivery. It assumes Git as a single source of truth and enables developers to define applications and infrastructures declaratively, automating most workflows. Being a fairly new and nascent idea in the world of software delivery, GitOps is constantly evolving. Here are some of the main ideas that are shaping GitOps today. In this article, we outline the 6 key ideas shaping GitOps. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

The cloud-native ecosystem has steadily grown over the past decade with the promise of faster deployments, cost-efficient infrastructure, and auto-scalability spurring its growth. Businesses are now developing and deploying easily scalable, cost-efficient, and more resilient applications, thus delivering innovative solutions faster and more efficiently. Yet the more frequent deployments present a problem: smaller windows of opportunity to find and fix security vulnerabilities.

A common question that comes up when writing AST-based tooling in Go is &#34;how do I find a node&#39;s parent?&#34;, or more generally, &#34;what are all the ancestors of a given node?&#34; Go&#39;s AST package does not come with parent links out of the box; this is a common choice in AST libraries [1] . Parent links are rarely needed, but they carry significant overheads in terms of memory usage and CPU time. Typical AST nodes can be fairly compact and adding a pointer to each node can increase its size considerably.

Backup is a fundamental aspect of application protection. As such, the need for a seamlessly integrated, centralized backup service is vital when seeking to ensure resilience and recoverability for data generated by Google Cloud services or on-premises infrastructure.  Regardless of whether the need to restore data is triggered by a user error, malicious activity, or some other reason, the ability to execute reliable, fast recovery from backups is a critical aspect of a resilient infrastructure.

But flexible, dynamic culture and tools are one way that organizations can stay on course through unsteady waters. And one way to achieve dynamic flexibility is through composable business practices. Picture your business as a collection of different components, like interlocking structures made of small building blocks.

## [Optimizing terabyte-scale PostgreSQL migrations to Cloud SQL with Searce](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/reduce-downtime-for-postgresql-migration-to-google-cloud-sql/)


Google Cloud allows you to move your PostgreSQL databases to Cloud SQL with Database Migration Service (DMS) . DMS gives you the ability to replicate data continuously to the destination database, while the source is live in production, enabling you to migrate with minimum downtime. However, terabyte-scale migrations can be complex. For instance, if your PostgreSQL database has Large Objects , then you will require some downtime to migrate them manually as that is a limitation of DMS.

BigQuery is a leading data warehouse solution in the market today, and is valued by customers who need to gather insights and advanced analytics on their data.
