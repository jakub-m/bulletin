During times of sparse funding, many startups who are facing headwinds will consider M&amp;A options to get a soft or moderately profitable landing for their teams. But does anyone actually want to acquire you? Getting acquired is like meeting the world’s worst in-laws: Judgmental, money-obsessed, potentially driven by ego reasons that are impossible to fully divine.” Not having great answers to all of these questions isn’t a blocker to getting acquired. Same question as geography, but for industry.

Once you transition into an engineering executive role, you’ll still have peers, but they’re a different sort of peer, who will look at problems from a very different perspective than yours.

In the digital era, it’s all about speed. It’s how businesses both excel and compete. And if you’re in the software business, speed is defined as getting changes - bug fixes, new features, or updates for back-end operations - in the hands of the customers faster. This can be measured through higher deployment, faster lead time to change, and reduced developer toil – and one way to improve all three is continuous delivery. CD aims to automate and streamline the software development process.”

Introduction In episode 3, Miki implemented a type that satisfied Go’s error interface. The odd thing about his type was it would be considered not-nil although no value was set for it. To get a better understanding of the situation, Miki gives a brief explanation of how Go determines if an error value is nil, and in this case, Miki specified the type of the variable returned to be a pointer of his custom error type which blindsided Go’s mechanism to determine a nil value.

Revenue gets all the glory in the land of tech. The unlimited upside! Growth cures all! The next digit unlocks the next round! Don&#39;t get me wrong, without revenue, without paying customers, there&#39;s nothing. But once there&#39;s something, costs count just as well to the bottom line as does revenue – if you care about profits, and you should. Profits equal independence, sustainability, and, ultimately, prosperity. But costs aren&#39;t just about the bottomline, they&#39;re also a measure of efficiency.

Since declaring our intention to leave the cloud in October, we&#39;ve been busy at work making it so. After a brief detour down a blind alley with an enterprise Kubernetes provider , we found our stride building our own tools, and successfully moved the first small application out of the cloud a few weeks ago. Now our sights are set on a total cloud exit by the end of the Summer, and by our preliminary calculations, we stand to save about $7m in server expenses over five years from doing so.

Despite the fact that most other rich countries have a far more efficient process, many Americans believe that adopting this process here is either impossible, immoral, or both.

## [Dobry kalendarz](https://www.kubafilipowski.com/blog/2023/2/22/dobry-kalendarz)


Jakiś czas temu pisałem o aplikacjach, których zacząłem używać w zeszłym roku . Po tym wpisie dostałem kilka rekomendacji innych aplikacji, które warto wypróbować. Aplikacja, której zacząłem używać i bardzo polubiłem to Cron , którą polecił mi Mateusz . Cron to kalendarz ma Maca. Mają też appkę na iOS, ale to appka desktopowa zrobiła na mnie największe wrażenie. Kalendarz to nic nowego. Cron robi małe rzeczy najlepiej z kalendarzy jakich używałem do tej pory (wiele). Ma tryb jasny i ciemny.

Trafiłem na wątek na Twitterze na temat inwestowania venture capital w projekty oparte o generatywne AI. W skrócie, argument Tylera Tringasa jest taki: większość nowych projektów AI to “API calle” do OpenAI. To sprawia, że większość wartości z tej technologii zostanie podzielona między firmami, które dostarczają API (np OpenAI), a dużymi firmami, które dodadzą AI jako nową funkcję. Generatywne AI to feature, a nie product . Myślę, że to pochopna opinia. Microsoft jest ewidentnym liderem.

Posted by Aviral Kumar, Student Researcher, and Sergey Levine, Research Scientist, Google Research Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can learn skills to solve decision-making tasks like playing games , enabling robots to pick up objects , or even optimizing microchip designs . However, running RL algorithms in the real world requires expensive active data collection .e.e., only data from highly suboptimal policies). The fine-tuning from offline gameplay data is illustrated below.
