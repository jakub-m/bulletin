This is a story in three acts, where we go from “trying to procure more nuclear power plants in 2024 is nuts”, to “I could see why you’d want some nuclear”, to “but if so, not like this”. This post has been quite a trip to write, where I rediscovered that writing something down is an ACE way to find out you didn’t know what you were talking about. It was also a good exercise in changing my mind a few times.

I’m also the kind of tinkerer that is looking for how to use technology in weird and wonderful ways. So, I’ve been looking at how to use GenAI in my smart home. Before we get into that part of the story, a little bit of context around something I was doing recently.

Throughout her career at the forefront of American diplomacy and foreign policy, Rice has been no stranger to high-stakes situations that hinge on clear and candid communication. As she says, “I&#39;m very direct. I don&#39;t believe in playing games, going around people, and being passive-aggressive. I shoot straight.

As a first example, natural numbers form a lattice , but they are not a finite-height lattice ; the following chain can be made infinitely long: $$ 0 &amp;lt; 1 &amp;lt; 2 &amp;lt; ... In the specific case where both \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) are the sign lattice (\(L_1 = L_2 = \text{Sign} \)) we can observe that the longest chains have five elements...

The first laptop I ordered back when my Linux journey began was the Framework 13 . I immediately liked a lot about it. The keyboard is a big step up over the MacBook Pro, primarily because of the 50% longer key travel. And I love the matte screen and 3:2 aspect ratio. Both feel way nicer for programming.  But running a 2256x1504 resolution on a 13. This, more than even the difference in battery life, was why I kept looking around at other PC laptops.8 font sizing with Linux . Very cool.

## [Linearizability: A Correctness Condition for Concurrent Objects](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/08/linearizability-correctness-condition.html)


This paper is from Herlihy and Wing appeared in ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 1990. This is the canonical reference for the linearizability definition. I had not read this paper in detail before, so I thought it would be good to go to the source to see if there are additional delightful surprises in the original text. Hence, this post. I will dive into a technical analysis of the paper first, and then discuss some of my takes toward the end. History in Fig 1.  THEOREM 2.

Garbage Collection and Metastability Cleaning up is hard to do. I’ve written a lot about stability and metastability , but haven’t touched on one other common cause of metastability in large-scale systems: garbage collection. GC is great. Garbage collected languages like Javascript, Java, Python, and Go power a big chunk of the internet’s infrastructure. Until Rust came along, choosing memory safety typically implied choosing garbage collection. Both language-level GCs and similar systems (e.g.

Capella Space is an 8-year-old manufacturer and operator of a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite fleet. These satellites can see through clouds, smoke and rain and can capture images day or night at resolutions as fine as 32cm. The company has raised $250M to date and has 200 employees working towards building an operational fleet of 36 satellites. The size of the fleet is important as with 12 orbital planes, 36 satellites could revisit any location on Earth every hour.1 GHz .0.26.4.0.38..

Observability is invaluable in LLMOps. Whether we’re talking about pretraining or agentic networks, it’s paramount that we understand what’s going on inside our systems to control, optimize, and evolve them. The infrastructure, effort, and scale required to achieve observability vary significantly. I recently gave a talk about this topic at the AI Engineer World’s Fair…

Developers typically choose between porting the code or dynamic linking to run native code on the JVM. This article examines these approaches, using SQLite as an example, and introduces a third option: Chicory Wasm runtime. This alternative combines the advantages of traditional methods while addressing their limitations, potentially offering a more secure solution to integrate native code. By Benjamin Eckel

Incidents are often perceived as extraordinary aberrations, unconnected to &#34;normal&#34; work. For over twenty years, the field of Resilience Engineering has aimed at flipping this approach around — by understanding what makes incidents so rare (relative to when and how they do not happen) and so minor (relative to how much worse they can be) and deliberately enhancing what makes that possible.

## [All about span events: what they are and how to query them](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/08/15/all-about-span-events-what-they-are-and-how-to-query-them/)


If you’re already familiar with distributed tracing, you know that spans are the building blocks of traces. But are you sleeping on what span events can do for you? First, you may need a wake-up call as to what a span event even is. While spans represent units of work or operation within a trace, a span event is a unique point in time during the span’s duration . Span attributes are also lightweight, but they lack the ability to store timestamps, which is where events really shine. syntax.

Let’s cut to the chase: Managing metric volumes at scale is hard. In fact, when we asked the open source observability community about their biggest concerns in this year’s Grafana Labs Observability Survey , the top four responses — cost, complexity, cardinality, and signal-to-noise ratio — can all be tied back to exponential growth in telemetry data. Adaptive Metrics has delivered a 35% reduction in metrics costs on average for more than 1,200 organizations . Save yourself some money.

## [Solving pg_upgrade and lc_collate Mismatch Issues in PostgreSQL](https://www.percona.com/blog/solving-pg_upgrade-and-lc_collate-mismatch-issues-in-postgresql/)


Character collations determine the sort order and classification of characters. When creating a database with initdb, PostgreSQL normally sets the collation based on the operating system’s locale settings, but other special collations, such as “C,” “POSIX,” and “ucs_basic,” are available as alternatives. On Linux systems, updates to glibc can bring changes to collation rules. Normally, […]
