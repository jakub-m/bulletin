                        My job these days is researching exotic software technologies and selling them to companies, which means I’m a software evangelist. And because I literally cannot turn my brain off ever , I started thinking about what “evangelism” actually means . Evangelism is an “embarrassing job”: SE culture looks down on evangelism, considering it untrustworthy. I’m not doubting the valid reasons. My audience is developers, not CTOs, project managers, etc. So let’s pretend evangelism is just output for now.

                        How do you recreate the experience of an in-person screening room with a remote, distributed team? This is one of the reasons we built Dropbox Replay , our new video collaboration tool. Dropbox customers told us the shift to virtual work had turned their once-straightforward review sessions into lengthy, inefficient video calls. It was clear their previous in-person workflows hadn’t made an elegant transition online. We created Dropbox Replay’s Live Review feature in response. Individually (i.e.

                        Here&#39;s a theory I have about cloud vendors (AWS, Azure, GCP): Cloud vendors will increasingly focus on the lowest layers in the stack: basically leasing capacity in their data centers through an API. Other pure-software providers will build all the stuff on top of it.

Blog topic generators! My first test was a simple wooden coin that I made on some cheap wood from the hobby store. Rather than having heads and tails, I put a padlock on it. One side of the coin is &#34;unlocked&#34; and the other is &#34;locked&#34;. Yesterday, I decided to engrave some wooden dice based on the most common topics that I&#39;ve blogged about.

                        <div class="description">
                        The idea of a “veil of ignorance” was a thought experiment coined by the philosopher John Rawls. He proposes that if you were to design a society without knowing your place within it (you are behind a “veil of ignorance”) you would design a society that was more impartial and just. This is because it is rational, in this scenario, to ensure that wherever you land in this society you won’t be much worse off than anyone else. I think this can also be applied to the world of programming.

                        The State of DevOps report released by Puppet each year is a great indicator of the pulse of the DevOps movement at the time. In its 10th edition this year, the report has continued to focus on the key challenges faced by organizations and solutions to them. This year, the report digs deeper into these issues and provides great insight for organizations that want to move to higher levels of DevOps maturity. In this post, we cover the key points from the report.&#34; This term is rather unclear.

Want het lijkt er soms wel op alsof er geen enkele vooruitgang geboekt is, en we hier nooit meer uit gaan komen, maar dat is echt niet zo.

Het virus, de vaccins, de reacties van mensen, ze blijven ons verbazen. Maar een ding is inmiddels wel constant: geïnformeerde mensen in de buitenwereld zien maanden van tevoren ontwikkelingen aankomen die daarna tot het uiterste genegeerd worden door onze politieke leiders.

Naturally, a great deal of phishing schemes that precede these bank account takeovers begin with a spoofed text message from the target&#39;s bank warning about a suspicious Zelle transfer.

                        We’ve added more user roles to make it easier to manage access to your network. Now, in addition to your tailnet Owner, Admins, and Members, you can give users the roles of Network Admin, IT Admin, and Auditor. This lets users access the admin console without the full permissions of an Admin. The new roles are: Network Admin, who can manage ACLs and other network settings. Use this role for the Networking team, to manage your network topology including DNS and subnets.

That&#39;s especially true for cloud services where a simple configuration error can expose sensitive assets to the entire Internet. On today&#39;s Day Two Cloud podcast we discuss how to incorporate security checks into your Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) workflows.

It was founded in 2011 to automate builds and tests for Ruby, but now supports over thirty languages including JavaScript, Python, and Java. It was an early leader in CI, in which developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository for automated builds and tests, a key aspect of DevOps practices. Today, however, there are plenty of other options. The quality of service can differ as well.

The thing that prevents awk from being a major part of my daily routine is that it (amazingly) has poor CSV support. I would love to see awk with “CSV mode”, where it intelligently handles formats like this if you just pass a flag.
