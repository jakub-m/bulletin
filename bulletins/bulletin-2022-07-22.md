I’ve been confused about what’s going on with terminals for a long time. But this past week I was using xterm.js might seem like a New Thing, but it’s really not. In the 70s, computers were expensive. So many employees at an institution would share a single computer, and each person could have their own “terminal” to that computer. For example, here’s a photo of a VT100 terminal from the 70s or 80s.js . This program is very insecure but it’s simple and great for learning. .Syscall( syscall.

by Aryan Mehra with Farnaz Karimdady Sharifabad , Prasanna Vijayanathan , Chaïna Wade , Vishal Sharma and Mike Schassberger Aim and Purpose — Problem Statement The purpose of this article is to give insights into analyzing and predicting “out of memory” or OOM kills on the Netflix App. Unlike strong compute devices, TVs and set top boxes usually have stronger memory constraints. With large data, comes the opportunity to leverage the data for predictive and classification based analysis.

## [Measuring downstream impact on social networks by using an attribution framework](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/measuring-downstream-impact-on-social-networks)


Co-authors: Qiannan Yin, Derek Koh, and Jenny Wu The network effect in social networks increases the complexity of conducting analysis, as the actions of members have the ability to impact others within the network. For instance, a member posting an article on LinkedIn could result in actions downstream where other members see the post and interact with it by means of liking, commenting, or sharing.

Over the last week, FotoForensics has been absolutely inundated with hundreds of copies of the same picture: the deep field view of galaxy cluster SMACS 0723. Seriously, we received 257 copies of this picture on the first day it came out, and even more over the following days. While all are visually similar, they differ by image dimensions, compression level, metadata, cropping, coloring, etc. Some even include annotations. The original picture was 4537x4630, but this version is 720x735....40&#34;.

Your words — are they credible? Or are they what Paul Oyer calls “cheap talk?” According to professor of economics Paul Oyer, how our words align with our actions isn’t just a matter of communication, but a matter of economics too. Economic concepts hold in all areas of life, which Oyer’s research has explored in everything from Uber driving to online dating. “Economics is everywhere,” Oyer says. “It&#39;s an incredibly powerful lens to analyze almost anything in the real world.

## [Small Performance Cues](https://staysaasy.com/management/2022/07/19/small-performance-cues.html)


Over many years in industry, you start to see patterns that are suspiciously correlated with lower performance. All of these cues are highly associated with low performance in my observation, but more interestingly, all of them have nothing to do with low performance directly. They’re incidental symptoms that just happen to show up when someone is struggling. You could have a small emergency. You could lose track of time. A one-on-one meeting might go long.

## [How I went about learning Rust](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2022/how-i-went-about-learning-rust/)


Rust has been on my radar for a long time now , and about a year ago I finally began allocating some time every week to learning it. In this post I&#39;ll provide details on the learning path I&#39;ve followed for Rust, in the hope that this may prove useful for others. You&#39;ll note that this isn&#39;t exactly a &#34;Learn X in 24 hours&#34; kind of journey, as it stretches over a long time period and covers lots of different materials. YMMV.

This blog post has been authored by Daniel Holbach and Stacey Potter. The team around GitOps Days came together back in the middle of 2020 with the mission to educate the world about the leaps that GitOps had made as a methodology and tool chain. A secondary objective of the group was to create a community for GitOps maintainers, engineers, practitioners and users and brighten everyone&#39;s day during the first wave of lockdowns. Weave GitOps is built on extending Flux. Watch the demo.

Testing also prevents changes in the codebase that can affect other parts of the code, enabling you to measure the quality of the software and eliminate any errors before users can interact with it. Most development teams use unit and integration tests assess their software. You should make this measurement as often as required.

Somewhat less familiar is the concept of edge computing. The genesis of the “edge” dates to the first content delivery networks in the 1990s. Since then, the edge concept has primarily been the domain of network engineers.

Developers started to notice just how big our JavaScript package was and yeah, we knew. We weren’t ignoring the issues; after all, we don’t want the Sentry package to be the cause of a slowdown. But to reduce our JavaScript SDK package size effectively we had to account for shipping new capabilities, like being able to manage the health of a release and performance monitoring, while maintaining a manageable bundle size. After all, new features == bigger package - usually.

## [Terraform Import - Leaving Click Opps Behind](https://earthly.dev/blog/terraform-lambda/)


From Click Ops To GitOps Previously I built a REST API , deployed it into a container and got it all running on AWS as a Lambda. But setting this up involved just clicking around in AWS and occasionally using the AWS CLI. Today, I’m going to port that whole setup to Terraform so that its easier to manage, reproduce, and make changes to. ( These are the purported benefits of Terraform, or so my coworker Corey tells me. I’ve never used it before so I’ll be learning as I go.......22.0...22.lock.18.

We recently started using Dev Containers and Codespaces for development on our Jekyll blog here at Earthly. We have a lot of different plugins and dependencies to make things like linting, spell check, and image importing much easier. The problem is, a lot of this was originally set up on an Intel Mac. Not only did Dev Containers with Codespaces solve this issue for us, it made development in general much easier and more portable. They’re great for standardizing development across a team.json ..

This paper, which appeared in USENIX ATC&#39;22 last week, describes the evolution of the design and implementation of DynamoDB in response to experiences operating it since its launch in 2012. DynamoDB has massive scale. In 2021, during the 66-hour Amazon Prime Day shopping event, Amazon systems made trillions of API calls to DynamoDB, peaking at 89.2 million requests per second. DynamoDB powers Alexa, Amazon.com sites, and all Amazon fulfillment centers. First some clarification is in order.e.g.

## [ High Throughput Replication with Integrated Membership Management (USENIX ATC 2022)](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/07/high-throughput-replication-with.html)


This paper, which appeared at USENIX ATC 2022, introduces ChainPaxos.  ChainPaxos applies ideas from chain replication to the MultiPaxos protocol. ( Here is an overview of chain replication if you are unfamiliar with it.) Since ChainPaxos is a Paxos protocol, its fault-tolerance is independent of an external coordination service. This allows for continuous execution of operations during reconfigurations, and uncoupling of the system&#39;s fault-tolerance from that of an external service.

Venue, logistics, and travel The conference was held at the Omni La Costa Resort at Carlsbad CA. Carlsbad is 30 miles from San Diego, still an easy to access place compared to earlier SOSP/OSDI venues. This didn&#39;t stop my Lyft driver to complain; he asked me why they are not holding the conference in one of the ample city venues. I told him, this is part of the tradition. The resort was nice and clean. It had splash pools, which was great for people traveling with kids.4% acceptance ratio.

This week I attended the USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI) conference , which was held at San Diego (well, at Carlsbad, CA to be more accurate). A big appeal of OSDI this year was that it was colocated with USENIX ATC . This allowed participants to attend two great conferences for the price of one registration and with one trip. Despite this allure, OSDI22 was still far from its pre-Covid glory and buzz. No CAP-like grand-conjecture from Eric this year.

In this Fully-Connected episode, Daniel and Chris explore DALL-E 2, the amazing new model from Open AI that generates incredibly detailed novel images from text captions for a wide range of concepts expressible in natural language. Along the way, they acknowledge that some folks in the larger AI community are suggesting that sophisticated models may be approaching sentience, but together they pour cold water on that notion.
