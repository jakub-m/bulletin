Ruchir Jha , Brian Harrington , Yingwu Zhao TL;DR Streaming alert evaluation scales much better than the traditional approach of polling time-series databases. It allows us to overcome high dimensionality/cardinality limitations of the time-series database. It opens doors to support more exciting use-cases. Engineers want their alerting system to be realtime, reliable, and actionable. While actionability is subjective and may vary by use-case, reliability is non-negotiable.

## [Some mistakes I made as a new manager](https://www.benkuhn.net/newmgr/)


This post was adapted from a “management roundtable” I gave at Anthropic . I had an unusually hard time becoming a manager: I went back and forth three times before it stuck, mostly because I made lots of mistakes each time. Since then, as I had to grow my team and grow other folks into managing part of it, I’ve seen a lot of other people have varying degrees of a rough time as well—often in similar ways. Managing doesn’t have that kind of feedback. I asked people for feedback.g.g.g. Drew.e.

Honeypots provide a great opportunity for identifying how attackers operate, how to defend your servers, and how to protect your privacy. They allow the operators to evaluate new threats and test different response options without putting the production servers at risk. My honeypots have been collecting a lot of data. Interestingly, most of the logs show ICMP echo-request packets (aka &#34;ping&#34;). Ping is one of the simplest diagnostic tools . IPv4 has 3. Your server has a domain name.com).228.95.@.

## [Tackling Technology Strategy with Portfolio Management](https://sookocheff.com/post/architecture/tackling-technology-strategy-with-portfolio-management/)


Application Portfolio Management (APM) draws inspiration from financial portfolio management, which has been around since at least the 1970s. By looking at all applications and services in the organization and analyzing their costs and benefits, you can determine the most effective way to manage them as part of a larger overall strategy. This allows the architect or engineering leader to take a more strategic approach to managing their application portfolio backed by data.

We will define one person of compute as 20 PFLOPS (64 A100s, or a single dense 42U A100 rack). We are in the era of the 1 rack person, consuming about 30kW to provide those 20 PFLOPS. LLaMA was trained on a cluster of 2048 A100s, with ~312 TFLOPS each. 2048 is currently the most A100s that can work together on a model due to the switch topology. The cluster has 639 PFLOPS, or 32 people of compute. Large LLaMA used ~1M GPU hours to train. Meaning it used the cluster for 500 hours (3 weeks).

## [Rooting Out Red Tape At Your Startup](https://staysaasy.com/management/2023/04/25/breaking-down-red-tape-at-your-startup.html)


Larger teams get less done per-person. At a certain point, teams hit a wall where incremental hires actually slow them down, and a larger organization gets less done per-person than a smaller one would. This is why hiring freezes and even layoffs can actually increase output for some companies. Larger companies accumulate red tape as they grow, like barnacles on a whale. There are more layers of communication, more status updates, and more processes. The Lengthy Explanation is key.

In the 1995 cult classic film Clueless there is a thirty second sequence that fashion fanatics still talk about to this day: The idea of having a computer program that knows what’s in your closet and that can help you experiment with different combinations of garments has really captured people’s imagination. With the rise of generative diffusion-based tools, we thought now might be the right time to check if the Clueless closet can be brought to life or not. We will fix that later.

## [Getting America&#39;s mojo back](https://world.hey.com/dhh/getting-america-s-mojo-back-7889dec1)


There is no end to accounts of America&#39;s current ailments. From deaths of despair, soaring crime in some cities, ballooning debts, dysfunctional politics, and a raging culture war. It&#39;s easy to be down on those United States. Too easy, in fact. Take gun deaths, for example. Americans own more guns per capita than any other country in the world, and by a huge margin too. Those guns are used by people to kill others and themselves. Suicides by gun haven&#39;t really swung that much either. Proudly so.

See on O’Reilly’s website for The Engineering Executive’s Primer . In 2019, I worked with Stripe Press to publish my first book, An Elegant Puzzle , which captured many of the lessons I’d learned as an engineering manager in fast growing Silicon Valley companies. I wrote both books because I kept working with very talented individuals who were nonetheless lost in their roles. As I worked in my first engineering executive role at Calm, it became hard to ignore the drumbeat of recurring questions.

I read this great article recently by the inimitable Juan Ojeda. It was about using ChatGPT to try and write the code for an app. You should go read it. The problem he faced was not that the code didn’t work, it worked fine. The problem was trying to communicate an unambiguous set of requirements, or said differently the problem is that human languages are designed to communicate with humans, not machines.

So, as an experiment, I asked GPT4: Now I should make clear that the AI got the details wrong . The article was written by Gary Taubes, not Adrian Thompson, and it was published in 1998.

No-code/low-code is the new hypename for tools that help you Do Computer Stuff without needing (much) programming skills. There are lots of tools in this space, most targeted at businesses, many selling themselves with “you won’t need a software developer”. I think the first use of low-code was in 2011 but this kind of “rapid application development” goes at least as far back as Visual Basic 6 . 1 Many no-code tools are visual builders, which looks “easier” to nontechnical people. At least .  ↩

OpenTelemetry is an open-source project that brings together tools, SDKs, and APIs for collecting telemetry--that is, logs, metrics, and traces---in a standardized way. The goal of the project is to help developers and operators instrument highly distributed applications and services to understand dependencies, monitor performance, and quickly troubleshoot problems. On today&#39;s Day Two Cloud podcast we explore OpenTelemetry and how it works. Our guest is Ben Hall.

Developers often believe that software performance follows a Pareto distribution: 80% of the running time is spent in 20% of the code. Using this model, you can write most of your code without any care for performance and focus on the narrow pieces of code that are performance sensitive. Engineers like Casey Muratori have rightly … Continue reading Hotspot performance engineering fails
