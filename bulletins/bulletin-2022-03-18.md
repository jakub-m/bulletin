It lets people from different location join a video viewing session, watching a movie together and also chatting while at it.

Happy Pi Day! 1 To celebrate I want to get away from software for a bit and talk about something special. You may have heard the story that the Indiana legislature tried to change the value of π, to something like 3 or 4 or 3.15 or something like that. This is usually shared as evidence that Indianans are dumb hicks, but I don’t like leaving things at that. Why did they try to change π and what did they expect to happen? I did the research, and now you get to hear the whole story.00001% off.2.

Camera uploads is a feature in our Android and iOS apps that automatically backs up a user’s photos and videos from their mobile device to Dropbox. The feature was first introduced in 2012, and uploads millions of photos and videos for hundreds of thousands of users every day. People who use camera uploads are some of our most dedicated and engaged users. They care deeply about their photo libraries, and expect their backups to be quick and dependable every time. Uploading is a two step process.

Welcome back. I’m an experienced developer learning Golang. Last time I moved my service from REST to gRPC, but there are times when a simple REST end-point is still needed. So today, I’m going to build a gRPC gateway that accepts HTTP requests and proxies it through to my gRPC service. And for fun, I’m going to do it three ways. I’ll first build a proxy using grpc-gateway and an existing proto file. This method is excellent if you have a gRPC service that you don’t want to touch.pb.golang......

Benford&#39;s law is a really fascinating observation that in many real-life sets of numerical data, the first digit is most likely to be 1, and every digit d is more common than d&#43;1 . Here&#39;s a table of the probability distribution, from Wikipedia: Now, the caveat &#34; real-life data sets&#34; is really important. Specifically, this only applies when the data spans several orders of magnitude. In this short post I&#39;ll try to explain how I understand Benford&#39;s law, and why it intuitively makes sense.

## [Hard to work with.](https://lethain.com/hard-to-work-with/)


Managing teams has taught me a lot about my own behaviors and motivations. For example, I overworked for a long time. This left me continually teetering on the brink of burnout, and I had no energy left to absorb the typical sorts of organizational changes that happen at any company. Despite doing good work, I handled change poorly, and I picked up the reputation for being difficult to manage. After seeing it in others several times, I came to notice it in myself.

Hello! Today I want to talk about – how do you know you’re getting better at programming? One obvious approach is: make goals periodically check if you achieved those goals if you did, celebrate I kind of hate goals Goals can be useful, but a lot of the time I actually find them stressful and not that helpful. In reality, I didn’t have any real reason to learn C&#43;&#43; then and I still don’t now. So it makes sense that I haven’t learned it. Instead of goals, I like to think about tiny milestones .

“A mistake that some leaders make is to assume that the people in your organization share your core values. Some of the time some of them do, but there&#39;s a bunch who don&#39;t, and those are the most difficult sorts of situations.”  In this podcast episode, Political Science Professors Neil Malhotra and Ken Schotts sit down with host and lecturer Matt Abrahams, to discuss how to lead others whose values may not align with your own.” See Privacy Policy at https://art19.

TL;DR: Tailscale’s free plan is free because we keep our scaling costs low relative to typical SaaS companies. We care about privacy, so unlike some other freemium models, you and your data are not the product. Rather, increased word-of-mouth from free plans sells the more valuable corporate plans. I know, it sounds too good to be true. Let’s see some details. “Just keep doing what you’re doing.” Each month we send out a customer satisfaction survey as part of our newsletter. (I get it.0. ↩︎

When you connect to a web application on your tailnet over plain HTTP, you might get a security warning in your browser. Although your tailnet’s connections use WireGuard, which provides end-to-end encryption at the network layer, your browser isn’t aware of that encryption—so it looks for a valid TLS certificate for that domain. If you’re running a public web server, though, it will need to get the certificate from Tailscale to serve your sites over HTTPS on your tailnet.ts.ts.domain-alias.ts.

## [Clothing AI in a data fabric (Practical AI #171)](https://changelog.com/practicalai/171)


What happens when your data operations grow to Internet-scale? How do thousands or millions of data producers and consumers efficiently, effectively, and productively interact with each other? How are varying formats, protocols, security levels, performance criteria, and use-case specific characteristics meshed into one unified data fabric? Chris and Daniel explore these questions in this illuminating and Fully-Connected discussion that brings this new data technology into the light.

The incomparable Jessica Kerr is back with another grab-bag of amazing topics. We talk about her journey to Honeycomb, devs getting satisfaction from the code they write, why step one for her is “get that new project into production” and step two is observe it, her angst for the context switching around pull requests, some awesome book recommendations, how game theory and design can translate to how we skill up and level up our teams, and so much more.
