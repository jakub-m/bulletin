I know these are good practices; I’ve seen them work over and over again. But have no [scientific] data at all to support my conclusions. My question: lacking such data, how can I talk about something important like testing in an authoritative way? — Jake This is near and dear to my heart.

## [Upsert UUIDs with sqlc](https://adriano.fyi/posts/2024-03-07-upsert-uuids-with-sqlc/)


Problem synopsis I’m a huge fan of sqlc’s approach to code generation. I’ve seen sqlc called a reverse ORM , and I really like that moniker. However, as a sqlc newbie, I’m still discovering its edge cases. Today’s edge case is using postgres UPSERT queries with sqlc . The crux is that when upserting, it’s necessary for unique key conflicts to occur so that the UPDATE portion of the query executes. But non-null uuid Go types tend to have a zero-value of 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 .

Among a certain tech set, Kubernetes has earned a reputation as an unnecessarily complicated time-sink that startups should avoid. Using Kubernetes with a small team is seen as a sign of over-engineering. I’m guilty of taking pithy jabs myself. I might gripe about Kubernetes sometimes, but it really is a great piece of technology. I highly recommend it to all my competitors.

## [Unlocking Kafka&#39;s Potential: Tackling Tail Latency with eBPF](https://blog.allegro.tech/2024/03/kafka-performance-analysis.html)


At Allegro , we use Kafka as a backbone for asynchronous communication between microservices. With up to 300k messages published and 1M messages consumed every second, it is a key part of our infrastructure. A few months ago, in our main Kafka cluster, we noticed the following discrepancy: while median response times for produce requests were in single-digit milliseconds, the tail latency was much worse. Namely, the p99 latency was up to 1 second, and the p999 latency was up to 3 seconds.......

Deep learning models continue to dominate the machine-learning landscape. Whether it’s the original fully connected neural networks, recurrent or convolutional architectures, or the transformer behemoths of the early 2020s, their performance across tasks is unparalleled. However, these capabilities come at the expense of vast computational resources. Training and operating the deep learning models is expensive…

## [Protecting paths in macro expansions by extending UTF-8](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2024/03/05/)


After a year I’ve finally came up with an elegant solution to a vexing u-config problem. The pkg-config format uses macros to generate build flags through recursive expansion. Some flags embed file system paths, but to the macro system it’s all strings. The output is also ultimately just one big string, which the receiving shell splits into fields . If a path contains spaces, or shell metacharacters, u-config must escape them so that shells treat them as part of a token. The . If a .pc files....

And why you should keep a notebook too. There is a wonderful story in Walter Isaacson’s Leonardo Da Vinci’s biography about when he was writing Steve Jobs’ biography. Steve told Walter that he had all these documents, notes and emails from the 1990s that he would retrieve and share. Several weeks passed, yet there was no sign of these documents, so Walter wrote to Steve asking him if he had found them. There’s no logical sequence to the way your thoughts come out. There’s complete freedom.

When testing machine learning systems, we must apply existing test processes and methods differently. Machine Learning applications consist of a few lines of code, with complex networks of weighted data points that form the implementation. The data used in training is where the functionality is ultimately defined, and that is where you will find your issues and bugs. By Martin Karsberg

This is post was translated from Dutch using a locally run copy of the Mixtral LLM, using a very low-end GPU. I did some light editing here and there, but the translation is mostly fully automatic. The short version: organizations often hesitate for many years before outsourcing tasks, particularly in the field of ICT (Information and Communication Technology). During those years, valuable ICT employees leave because constantly justifying their own existence is frustrating.

There’s now also an English version of this post. De hele korte versie: organisaties twijfelen vaak vele jaren over het uitbesteden van dingen, met name ICT. Gedurende die jaren vertrekken de goede ICT-mensen, want steeds je eigen bestaan moeten rechtvaardigen is rot. Op termijn gaat er dan weleens iets goed mis, en is de keuze daarna makkelijk: we kunnen en willen dit niet meer zelf doen. Maar door jaren te twijfelen heb je het daar zelf naar gemaakt.

Apple&#39;s responses to the Digital Market Act, its recent 1.8b euro fine in the Spotify case, and Epic Sweden&#39;s plans to introduce an alternative App Store in the EU have all been laced with a surprising level of spite and obstinacy. Even when Steve Jobs was pulling power moves with Adobe and Flash or responding to Antennagate , we never saw such an institutional commitment to flipping off legislators and platform partners. It might have been ruthless, but it didn&#39;t come across as personal.

I&#39;ve gone around the computing world in the past eighty hours. I&#39;ve been flowing freely from Windows to Linux, sampling text editors like VSCode, neovim, Helix, and Sublime, while surveying PC laptops and desktops. It&#39;s been an adventure! But it&#39;s time to stop being a tourist. It&#39;s time to commit.   So despite my earlier reservations about giving up on TextMate, I&#39;ve decided to make Windows my new primary abode. That&#39;s Windows with Linux running inside of it as a subsystem (WSL), mind you.

During Ballmer&#39;s reign as CEO of Microsoft, the company always made plenty of money. While the stock traded sideways, Ballmer made sure it was still raining dividends. Yet, today, that era of Microsoft is not looked upon too fondly. It&#39;s seen as being anchored in the company&#39;s historic paranoia, Windows-centric world view, and as missing the boat on mobile.   Then along came Satya Nadella . It&#39;s currently the most valuable company in the world. A better company making better products.

I probably wouldn&#39;t have done a deep dive on Apple alternatives without the announcement that they were killing progressive web apps (PWAs) on the iPhone in the EU. Most people don&#39;t switch operating systems willy-nilly, and for good reason: They&#39;re different! And different is weird at first! But I&#39;m actually glad Apple gave me the final push to venture outside the walled garden for a longer stroll, because the expedition has been a delight. You might complain, but you won&#39;t leave.

Many a technologist has been inspired by science fiction. Some have even built, or rebuilt, entire companies around an idea introduced in a story they read, as the founders of Second Life and Meta did, working from the metaverse as imagined by Neal Stephenson in his seminal 1992 novel Snow Crash . IEEE Spectrum has a history of running amazing sci-fi stories. So when our News Manager Margo Anderson and Contributing Editor Charles Q. Cass, Choi, and Schroeder then had a brainstorming session.

In the past few months, we’ve seen a deepfake robocall of Joe Biden encouraging New Hampshire voters to “save your vote for the November election” and a fake endorsement of Donald Trump from Taylor Swift. It’s clear that 2024 will mark the first “AI election” in United States history. The company said it’s “building industry-leading tools that can identify invisible markers at scale—specifically, the ‘AI generated’ information in the C2PA and IPTC technical standards...

Every time you use your voice to generate a message on a Samsung Galaxy mobile phone or activate a Google Home device, you’re using tools Chanwoo Kim helped develop. The former executive vice president of Samsung Research’s Global AI Centers specializes in end-to-end speech recognition, end-to-end text-to-speech tools, and language modeling. “The most rewarding part of my career is helping to develop technologies that my friends and family members use and enjoy,” Kim says.D.D.S.D.D.

## [IEEE President’s Note: Let’s Get Practical](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ieee-presidents-note-march-2024)


If you ask longtime IEEE members why they have remained a member, you will get many different reasons. For me, IEEE is a community of technological professionals who help each other stay current, develop valuable professional skills, and work together to make the world a better place today and for generations to come. IEEE provides its members with many benefits and resources. The offerings members get value from can vary depending on what else is going on in their life and their career.”

## [AI Is Being Built on Dated, Flawed Motion-Capture Data](https://spectrum.ieee.org/motion-capture-standards)


Diversity of thought in industrial design is crucial: If no one thinks to design a technology for multiple body types, people can get hurt. The invention of seat belts is an oft-cited example of this phenomenon, as they were designed based on crash dummies that had traditionally male proportions, reflecting the bodies of the team members working on them. The same phenomenon is now at work in the field of motion-capture technology.” And sometimes these white male bodies were dead.”
