One of the nice things about being in software is I don’t have to dress up much. I still try to look good at conferences and events, but it’s more “shirt jacket over white tee” fashion, not “suit” look-good. “Fanciness” and “Comfort” are both optimization targets.  ↩

Depending on where you land on the spectrum, you might have no problem using a command-line interface; but for many folks, it’s a challenge. Portainer is an open-source service that provides a visual web view for containerized applications.

Dropbox originally used Amazon S3 and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as the backbone of its data storage infrastructure. Although we migrated user file data to our internal block storage system Magic Pocket in 2015, Dropbox continued to use S3 and HDFS as a general-purpose store for other internal products and tools. Among these use cases were crash traces, build artifacts, test logs, and image caching. Caches built against S3 burned pricey GET requests with each cache miss.

The past decade, one of the best ways to maximize compensation outcomes was to join a pre-IPO company issuing generous equity, then wait for the IPO. This strategy seems to be less profitable in 2022.

Understanding what changes were made to your Tailscale network, and who made them, is critical for maintaining the security and integrity of your network. That’s why we’re making it even easier for admins — and your auditors! — to review changes made to your tailnet’s configuration, such as adding devices, updating ACLs, or changing DNS settings. Configuration audit logs, now in beta, capture changes made to your network in the coordination server . See documentation for the Tailscale API .

NextDNS lets you choose exactly how you want to run a DNS resolver — but they run it for you, all over the world. (It’s a bit more robust and lower latency from other cities than that Pi of yours dangling off the shelf by your cable modem. Select “Override local DNS” to force your devices to use NextDNS.32 or later .

However, noticeably absent from this month&#39;s Patch Tuesday are any updates to address a pair of zero-day flaws being exploited this past month in Microsoft Exchange Server.

But new data released this week suggests that for some of the nation&#39;s largest banks, reimbursing account takeover victims has become more the exception than the rule.

For anyone outside of technical roles, approaches to software delivery like DevOps and GitOps can seem too abstract to be of real use. In a new executive briefing, we explain some of the most important business benefits of adopting a model like GitOps, focusing on areas that are vital for organizations across all sectors.

If you can’t give your developers the tools they need to deliver, they’ll work elsewhere. Developers want to be productive. And to be competitive, you need them to be productive, too. But as the cloud native era places more pressure on organizations to deliver software quickly, it can be easy to overlook the importance of the developer experience. In this article, we look at why it’s so important – and how GitOps can be used to give your developers what they need. But it’s not all bad news.

In computing, virtualization is the creation of a virtual — as opposed to a physical — version of computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and network resources. Virtualization creates virtual resources from physical resources, like hard drives, central processing units (CPUs), and graphic processing units (GPUs). By virtualizing resources, you can combine a network of resources into what appears to users as one object. Generally, people discussing containers mean application containers.

In this blog post, we hope to explain the value of this feature and how it can be used to further secure your workflows. By default contexts are unrestricted on CircleCI.

Yet limits on data are still too common, and prevent organizations from taking important steps forward — like launching a new digital business , understanding changes in consumer behavior , or even utilizing data to combat public health crises . Data complexity is at an all time high and as data volumes grow, data is becoming distributed across clouds, used in more workloads and accessed by more people than ever before.
