Use the code C0MPUT3RTHINGS for an additional 10% off.com . Maybe. Updating the Alloy workshop.1&#43;0.

## [Malicious code in PDF Toolbox extension](https://palant.info/2023/05/16/malicious-code-in-pdf-toolbox-extension/)


The PDF Toolbox extension for Google Chrome has more than 2 million users and an average rating of 4,2 in the Chrome Web Store. So I was rather surprised to discover obfuscated code in it that has apparently gone unnoticed for at least a year. The code has been made to look like a legitimate extension API wrapper, merely with some convoluted logic on top. It takes a closer look to recognize unexpected functionality here, and quite some more effort to understand what it is doing. location .json .

Hiring product builders who have great product sense is one of the most critical, make-or-break moves that a startup can make. A great product is the foundation for a successful tech business, and great products can only be built by teams with great product sense. I define high-quality product sense as the ability to do two things without having extensive data (i.e. Many people can get to a great product eventually via guess-and-check.

The whole thing is about 200 lines of Python, including implementing all of the binary DNS parsing from scratch. what’s a DNS resolver? A DNS resolver is a program that knows how to figure out what the IP address for a domain is. Here’s what the command line interface of the resolver you’ll write looks like: $ python3 resolve.py example.com 93.184.216.

There are many reasons to pick working for a bigger company in tech. The benefits, the pay, and, at least until recently , the job security. In many ways, it&#39;s hard to argue with the cold logic of taking a seat on a star destroyer, if you can land one. But odds are you&#39;ll be sitting on the bench if you do. That is, your talents won&#39;t get to play center stage in a way that really matters. That just isn&#39;t so in a small boat. If you&#39;re not rowing, everyone will notice.

This paper appeared in CIDR&#39;21 . This paper is also on operationalizing CALM theorem, and is a good companion to the CALM-CRDT paper we covered yesterday. The paper starts by pointing out the challenges of cloud programmability. It says that most developers find it hard to harness the enormous potential of the cloud, and that the cloud has yet to provide a programming environment that exposes the inherent power of the platform.

This paper is from VLDB&#39;22. It focuses on the read/querying problem of conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs). To solve this problem, it proposes extending CRDTs with a SQL API query model, applying the CALM theorem to identify which queries are safe to execute locally on any replica. The answer is of no surprise: monotonic queries can provide consistent observations without coordination. sets, such as the tags on a blog post or the members of a chat room.k.a. Early Read).

The future of space food could be as simple—and weird—as a protein shake made with astronaut breath or a burger made from fungus. For decades, astronauts have relied mostly on pre-packaged food, or the occasional grown lettuce, during their forays off our planet. With missions beyond Earth orbit in sight, a NASA-led competition is hoping…

Charging has emerged as the primary way people keep their EV batteries full of juice while on the go, but some companies have an alternative in mind that they think could be even quicker than the fastest chargers today: battery swapping. Today, a San Francisco–based startup called Ample demonstrated its new battery-swap system, which it…

Posted by AJ Piergiovanni and Anelia Angelova, Research Scientists, Google Video understanding is a challenging problem that requires reasoning about both spatial information (e.g., for objects in a scene, including their locations and relations) and temporal information for activities or events shown in a video. There are many video understanding applications and tasks, such as understanding the semantic content of web videos and robot perception .e.e.g., playing soccer, swimming, etc.).e.

It’s a mission that is particularly timely given the emergence of generative AI and chatbots .g.g. LIT v0.

We expect that future versions of this work could combine LLMs and RL in multi-turn dialogues. To begin, the assistant steers the conversation to sharks via a sound quiz.g.g.

Posted by Jerry Wei, Student Researcher, and Denny Zhou, Principal Scientist, Google Research There have recently been tremendous advances in language models, partly because they can perform tasks with strong performance via in-context learning (ICL), a process whereby models are prompted with a few examples of input-label pairs before performing the task on an unseen evaluation example.g. Learning the input-label mappings in context from the presented examples (e.g.g.g., 90% → 22.g.e.g.e.g.

Posted by Candice Schumann, Software Engineer, and Gbolahan O. Olanubi, User Experience Researcher, Google Research Skin tone is an observable characteristic that is subjective, perceived differently by individuals (e.g., depending on their location or culture) and thus is complicated to annotate. That said, the ability to reliably and accurately annotate skin tone is highly important in computer vision. Monk Skin Tone (MST) Scale See more at skintone.google . Images by TONL. Copyright TONL.S.

Posted by Weicheng Kuo and Anelia Angelova, Research Scientists, Google Research Detection is a fundamental vision task that aims to localize and recognize objects in an image. However, the data collection process of manually annotating bounding boxes or instance masks is tedious and costly, which limits the modern detection vocabulary size to roughly 1,000 object classes. In fact, feature grouping can nicely delineate object boundaries without any supervision.g.e.g.g..e., a loosely vs.g.

Despite the progress, these assistants still face limitations in supporting conversational interactions in mobile user interfaces (UIs), where many user tasks are performed.e.g. Example screen questions generated by the LLM.
