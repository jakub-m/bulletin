This article provides an introductory guide to reverse-engineering CMOS circuits, using this chip as an example. Although the chip looks like a tangle of lines at first, its large features and simple layout make it possible to understand its circuits. I&#39;ll first explain how to recognize the individual transistors. The chip turned out to be a 4-bit CMOS counter, a copy of the Motorola MC14516B .e.

A great marketing strategy can promote long-term profit and will significantly reduce the cost of customer acquisition. This can make a world of difference to your company — particularly if you’re a newcomer to the scene. This week’s article is written by the wonderful Katie Brenneman . Thank you, Katie, for writing this for me. However, marketing is an extremely competitive industry.

For users who have built out tailnets based on a GitHub login and had run into this issue, it&#39;s a small headache relieved. But it also reflects a bigger milestone — we were finally able to remove the “limitations” section from our “Invite any user” documentation.

Over the past couple months I’ve discovered a couple of handy tricks for working with GDB breakpoints. I figured these out on my own, and I’ve not seen either discussed elsewhere, so I really ought to share them. None have an occasionally useful secondary property: Optionally allow the program to continue through the defect. If the program reaches the body of any of these macros then there is no reliable continuation. Even manually nudging the instruction pointer over the assertion isn’t enough.

As in previous years, I&#39;ve pulled together a few statistics on code contributions to PostgreSQL. See previous posts in this series  for methodology and caveats. I calculate that, in 2023, there were 221 people who were the principal author of at least one PostgreSQL commit. 66% of the new lines of code were contributed by one of 18 people, and 90% of the new lines of code were contributed by one of 50 people. Here they are. Asterisks indicate non-committers. Here&#39;s how that looked in 2023.

This paper, from NSDI 2021, presents the design and implementation of strongly consistent replication in MongoDB using a consensus protocol derived from Raft. Raft provides fault-tolerant state-machine-replication (SMR) over asynchronous networks. Raft (like most SMR protocols) uses push-based replication. But MongoDB uses pull-based replication scheme, so when integrating/invigorating MongoDB&#39;s SMR with Raft, this caused challenges. This has big performance and monetory cost implications.e.e.c.

If you, like me, think of musical synthesizers as an artifact of 1970s rock and disco, then you, like me, will be surprised to learn that the first electronic synthesizer predates those genres by several decades In 1945, Hugh Le Caine , a physicist at Canada’s National Research Council, began working in his spare time on a single-channel musical instrument he dubbed the Electronic Sackbut. It could also synthesize other horns, as well as string and reed instruments.youtube.D. Miller agreed.W.R.

Engineers in the United States and Taiwan say they have demonstrated a promising new twist on nonvolatile memory that’s small enough, miserly when it comes to energy, and works at a low enough voltage that it could boost the abilities of future processors. The device is a type of phase-change memory , a class of memory that holds information in the form of resistance and changes that resistance by melting and reforming its own crystal structure. for use in superlattice PCRAM.5 picojoules.

Over the past decade, one of the biggest stories in semiconductors has been a surprise eclipsing of traditional silicon—in the field of power electronics, where silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) have raced past silicon to capture multibilllion-dollar segments of the market. And as major applications fell to these upstarts, with their superior attributes, a question naturally arose. Notably, the device also had very low resistance when conducting current. The bandgap of AlN is 6.26.

Citing “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union,” Amazon and iRobot have announced the termination of an acquisition deal first announced in August of 2022 that would have made iRobot a part of Amazon and valued the robotics company at US $1.4 billion.… We also preliminarily found that Amazon would have had the incentive to foreclose iRobot’s rivals because it would have been economically profitable to do so. So, that’s not great. Sigh. We believed we could. Robots are too complex.
