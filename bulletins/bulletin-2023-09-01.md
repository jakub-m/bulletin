For the typical DLL function call you declare the function prototype (via header file), you inform the link editor ( ld , link ) that the DLL exports a symbol with that name (import library), it matches the declared name with this export, and it becomes an import in your program’s import table. What happens when two different DLLs export the same symbol? The link editor will pick the first found. In PE executable images , an import isn’t just a symbol, but a tuple of DLL name and symbol.g.g.....

This paper appeared in Eurosys 2023. It shows how to generate test-cases from a TLA&#43; model of a distributed protocol and apply it to the Java implementation to check for bugs in the implementation. They applied the technique to Raft, XRaft, and Zab protocols, and presented the bugs they find. Background on the problem Bridging the gap between model (i.e., abstract protocol) to the implementation (i.e., concrete code) is an important problem. More on this later.g.lang.annotation package.

And yet most software, even open-source software, is downloaded in the form of compiled binaries, which are much more difficult to inspect. That approach proves the binaries have no backdoors or other changes not present in the source code, without having to disassemble or look inside them at all.21.0.

Five years ago I wrote an article about the shortcomings of Chrome Sync (as well as a minor issue with Firefox Sync). Now Chrome Sync has seen many improvements since then. So time seems right for me to revisit it and to see whether it respects your privacy now. Spoiler: No, it doesn’t. It improved, but that’s an improvement from outright horrible to merely very bad. The good news: today you can use Chrome Sync in a way that preserves your privacy. But that isn’t the main issue.

As an engineering manager, you may have prioritized becoming a strong closer, convincing candidates to join your team. As a more senior manager, you will have likely shifted focus to training others and spending time with candidates for particularly senior roles. As an engineering executive, your role in the hiring process will shift once again..

by David Vroom, James Mulcahy, Ling Yuan, Rob Gulewich In this post we discuss Netflix’s adoption of service mesh: some history, motivations, and how we worked with Kinvolk and the Envoy community on a feature that streamlines service mesh adoption in complex microservice environments: on-demand cluster discovery. Today we have a wealth of tools, both OSS and commercial, all designed for cloud-native environments. First, we’ve grown the number of different IPC clients.vip and myservice.svip ).

First of all, new TLA&#43; workshop! October 16th, details here . Use the discount code C0MPUT3RTHINGS for $100 off. But enough about business, I&#39;m here to complain. My painful, fruitless quest for programmable slideshow animations I&#39;m giving the Are We Engineers talk in Perth September and looking over the slides has reminded me of how much I hate slides. I started with PowerPoint but switched to Beamer in 2018 or so, which is a LaTeX package for making slide decks. So to hell with GUIs...js .to(&#39;.

In addition to running Product for a technology company at scale, I’ve also been fortunate enough to invest in and advise roughly a dozen other startups, primarily in SaaS. One of the most common sets of interesting discussions that I have with tech leaders concerns when startups should hire their first product manager. Many companies find it tempting to hire a first PM somewhere in the range of $250K to $1M ARR. This is particularly true before $1M ARR. This is poison to a young startup.

Deploying software updates to live environments has always been akin to walking on a tightrope. Traditional deployment methods often came wrapped with a set of challenges. Extended system downtimes, unanticipated bugs slipping into production, and the often tricky rollbacks when things didn’t pan out are some of the common pain points. For businesses, this translated to potential revenue losses, unhappy customers, and a stressed-out development team. Contact us for a demo today.

If there are frequent connection errors or downtime notifications, it becomes difficult to deliver an experience where people can connect and interact with ease. When faced with uptime challenges, being able to quickly escalate issues to network engineers helps ensure that people can work the way that they want to.

You might have heard a lot about code generation tools using AI, but could LLMs and generative AI make our existing code better? In this episode, we sit down with Mike from TurinTech to hear about practical code optimizations using AI “translation” of slow to fast code. We learn about their process for accomplishing this task along with impressive results when automated code optimization is run on existing open source projects.

However, modern object detectors are limited by the manual annotations of their training data, resulting in a vocabulary size significantly smaller than the vast array of objects encountered in reality. We are also releasing the code here .

Today on Day Two Cloud we dive into the implications of licensing changes that HashiCorp has made to its popular Terraform software. In short, the company has switched from an open source to a business source license. HashiCorp says it felt compelled to make the change to ensure that some other business entity doesn&#39;t take the open-source software and turn it into a competing product (looking at you, AWS).

In doing geospatial data science work, it is very important to think about optimizing the code you are writing. How can you make datasets with hundreds of millions of rows aggregate or join faster? This is where concepts such as spatial indices come in. In modern databases, this issue of querying and searching is also very pertinent.
