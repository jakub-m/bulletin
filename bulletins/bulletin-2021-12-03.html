                          Today I have the pleasure of announcing my new app— Max reHIT Workout —on Product Hunt . Max reHIT Workout is an exercise app that guides you through interval workouts. I won’t pitch the app here. I&#39;ll just say I’m proud of how it turned out and if you want an optimal algorithm for exercising, you might like it. I know I haven’t been writing much lately. That&#39;s because there’s been very little evolution in software system architecture. It’s pretty much same thing, different day.

                        Here&#39;s a theory I have about cloud vendors (AWS, Azure, GCP): Cloud vendors1 will increasingly focus on the lowest layers in the stack: basically leasing capacity in their data centers through an API. Other pure-software providers will build all the stuff on top of it.

From members’ inputs, we use AI models to extract their profile attributes or profile entities. This process is called Standardization and Knowledge Graph construction, and produces a knowledge graph of the entities a member is related to.

And this seems like a good time to talk about chess. My journey picking up on chess, again As a kid I wasn&#39;t much interested in chess. My younger brother was into chess, he would buy books to review grandmasters&#39; games. I didn&#39;t go further than playing casual games with him. Like Git, you know. The app also suggested me hints. https://en.

                        In January 2021, technology vendor Ubiquiti Inc. [NYSE:UI] disclosed that a breach at a third party cloud provider had exposed customer account credentials. In March, a Ubiquiti employee warned that the company had drastically understated the scope of the incident, and that the third-party cloud provider claim was a fabrication. On Wednesday, a former Ubiquiti developer was arrested and charged with stealing data and trying to extort his employer while pretending to be a whistleblower.

                        Today&#39;s Heavy Networking goes deep on Network Access Control (NAC) for wired and wireless networks. Our guest is Arne Bier, a Senior Consulting Engineer and CCIE. We hit a bunch of topics including MAC authentication bypass, client certificates, EAP methods, and more. We also discuss reasons why NAC is worth deploying despite the effort.

We partnered with them to help promote their awesome podcast. We hand picked this full-length episode to share with you because of its focus on using technology as a force for good, something we’re very passionate about.

We cover the early days of Electron before Electron was Electron, how she advocated to turn it into a product and make it a framework, how it’s used today, why she boomeranged back to GitHub to lead Sponsors, what’s next in funding open source creators, and we attempt to answer the question “what happens to open source once it’s funded?”
