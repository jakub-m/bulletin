But having tried most of the Twitter successor products, Threads instantly set itself apart in the immediate experience.

Fighting with hard drives TL;DR Link to heading Changing kubelet‚Äôs root directory can break CSI drivers and other components.

Motivation Link to heading I was setting up Kubernetes kubelet on a host with numerous NVMe drives . I thought ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs use this for ephemeral-storage in Kubernetes‚Äù. The host had no need for all these drives and Kubernetes could allow pods to claim them for ephemeral storage.

Conditional breakpoints are extremely useful, but everyone knows [citation needed] that they‚Äôre super slow, to the point where people stop using them. Visual Studio recently did some good improvements and @ryanjfleury still dunked on it for being too slow. But even raddbg takes ~2 seconds to execute 10000 iterations of a simple loop with conditional breakpoints inside. For comparison, the same loop without breakpoints takes less than 1ms.

## [Notes on Taylor and Maclaurin series](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2024/notes-on-taylor-and-maclaurin-series/)


A Maclaurin series is a power series - a polynomial with carefully selected coefficients and an infinite number of terms - used to approximate arbitrary functions with some conditions (e.g. differentiability). The Maclaurin series does this for input values close to 0, and is a special case of the Taylor series which can be used to find a polynomial approximation around any value. Intuition Let&#39;s say we have a function and we want to approximate it with some other - polynomial - function p(x) .

## [Understanding the Performance Implications of Storage-Disaggregated Databases](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/07/understanding-performance-implications.html)


Storage-compute disaggregation in databases has emerged as a pivotal architecture in cloud environments, as evidenced by Amazon ( Aurora ), Microsoft ( Socrates ), Google (AlloyDB), Alibaba ( PolarDB ), and Huawei (Taurus). This approach decouples compute from storage, allowing for independent and elastic scaling of compute and storage resources. It provides fault-tolerance at the storage level. You can even use the storage level for easier sharding of your database.4X) and writes (17.8X.¬†
