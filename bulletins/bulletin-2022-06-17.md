Gross margin is an essential concept, and is one of my favorite metrics in SaaS because it combines several key drivers of your business into one concise number. Gross margin is effectively a measure of a company’s efficiency and raw ability to be profitable, and is defined as: (Revenue - Cost of Revenue) / Revenue If Safeway sells you some bananas for a dollar, and it costs them $.80 to get those bananas, they have realized a gross margin of 20%: ($1 - $.80) / $1. That all costs money.

A few years ago I&#39;ve written in some detail about the Y combinator, including implementations in Clojure and Python. This short post is showing how to implement the Y combinator in Go using generics; in general, static typing makes the Y combinator somewhat less appealing, but I figured that generics will at least allow the implementation to be reasonably reusable. The full, runnable code for this post is available on GitHub . In Go, we need those to have explicit types. val &#43; recurse ( n .

Be up to date even more — low latency streaming to the rescue What is latency? Can you recall a situation when your neighbor was shouting through the wall because they knew that the football goal was scored before you did? Most of us have probably experienced it at least once. How is it possible that we are watching the same game but at a slightly different time? The answer is latency . This is commonly known as “glass-to-glass” or “end-to-end” latency. Ultra-low latency drops below 1 second.e.

I woke up and said good morning to Oscar. “Go away daddy, I don’t love you.” I went downstairs. “Daddy can’t eat breakfast with me, he is not fun and he makes me sad.” I loaded Oscar onto my bike to go to pre-school. “Mummy I love you so much but I don’t love daddy at all.” Apparently normal, but starting to get to me. He’s two and is civil to me sometimes, especially when we’re on our own. “No,” he said.

I used to work at Facebook. That was both the name of the service with all of the cat pictures and the name of the company that paid me every two weeks. The cat picture part still has the same name, but the parent company does not. It&#39;s called Meta now. I left well before any of that renaming happened. As a result, I have plenty of pictures that predate that change on my Macs and other Apple devices. It&#39;s no longer &#34;Facebook HQ&#34;. It&#39;s now &#34;Meta - Headquarters&#34;.

This paper presents a new way to reason about transaction-isolation based on application-observable states, in lieu of prior history-based approaches. This approach maps more naturally to what applications can observe, and facilitates comparing isolation guarantees. Moreover, defining isolation guarantees in terms of observable storage states frees definitions from implementation-specific assumptions and opens the way to find alternate implementations. The third condition is more complex.g.

## [Hacks Decoded: Bikes and Boomboxes with Samuel Aboagye](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/06/hacks-decoded-bikes-and-boomboxes-with-samuel-aboagye/)


Samuel Aboagye is a genius. Aboagye is 17 years old. In those 17 years, he’s crafted more inventions than you have, probably. Among them: a solar-powered bike and a Bluetooth speaker, both using recycled materials. We caught up with Aboagye over video chat in hopes that he’d talk with us about his creations, and ultimately how he’s way cooler than any of us at 17.

It’s so much nicer to read and write than the XML I had to write back in the early days of Java development. But one advantage XML had over YAML was that XML schemas were commonly used and so I wouldn’t get errors like this: Error parsing yaml file: map values are not allowed here in &#34;/Users/adam/sandbox/earthly-website/blog/authors.yml file.

The DevOps field is engaged in a great, collective migration into the cloud. Businesses are decentralizing their applications and databases, hosting them in the cloud to make them available regardless of geography or user device. Some organizations choose to host their applications on private servers, but in periods of high demand take advantage of the public cloud by directing overflow traffic to cloud servers. This approach is called cloud bursting . That leaves you open to human error.

June is Pride Month—a time for us to come together to bring visibility and belonging, and to celebrate the diverse set of experiences, perspectives, and identities of the LGBTQ&#43; community. Over the next few weeks, Lindsey Scrase, Managing Director, Global SMB and Startups at Google Cloud, will showcase conversations with startups led by LGBTQ&#43; founders and how they use Google Cloud to grow their businesses.  Lindsey : Thank you so much Devon and Matt for taking the time to speak with me today.
