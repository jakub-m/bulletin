## [Low Context - Software’s Silent Killer](https://staysaasy.com/software/2022/07/06/Context.html)


As companies grow, context can become a scarce resource. As more variables, people, teams, products, customers, and coworkers create an increasingly infinite combination of possible ways to move forward, deep context on what to do and how to do it should be thought of explicitly, because its thoughtful allocation can make, or, notably, break, a company’s productivity. However, context is much more fluid than decisions on fences and rewrites. People underestimate the power of context.g.

Intro These days, building a web application is highly complicated. Modern applications have to handle a lot of complex logic and features and are far more complex than building websites in the past. Developers often have to work in large codebases. They use many technologies, and different teams of programmers are involved in the project. Today’s web applications have introduced a lot of challenges to be faced and have forced developers to think more about scalable architecture./package.json&#34;).

On the web, python is mainly used for backend development, using frameworks such as Flask and Django. Since the World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) announced web assembly specifications as an official web standard, developers of various languages have seemed to support their favorite language on the Web, with Python developers having Pyodide to their rescue.random.

There’s a Right Way to conduct job interviews: one-on-one, with a single interviewer per interview session. If you need multiple interviewers (you probably do), schedule multiple sessions, each one-on-one. The alternate approach, panel interviews – having multiple interviewers in a session at once – is almost always a bad practice. It increases stress on the candidate, risks measuring the wrong things, and doesn’t lead to better results. Avoid panel interviews: they don’t work .

At the time, that sounded suspiciously like, “Stop wasting my time,” but operating in an executive role has shifted my perspective a bit: this is actually a surprisingly useful thing to learn. The P&amp;L statement is a map of a company’s operation and is an effective tool for pointing you towards the most pressing areas to dig in.hashicorp.

For as long as we can recall, CI/CD has been at the center stage of DevOps and it has served well to improve deployment velocity and quality of code being shipped. Nonetheless, the demands of modern cloud-native applications require the adoption of GitOps to make the deployment process more Git-centric, and at the same time, leveraging approaches like progressive delivery to deploy with greater confidence.

Kubernetes Ingress Overview Kubernetes Ingress is an API object that manages external users’ access to the services within a Kubernetes cluster. Through the use of routing rules, access to the cluster can be configured, which are defined on the Ingress resource. Typically, HTTPS/HTTP routing protocols are used to facilitate the routing. Ingress provides a single entry point for the cluster, allowing for easier management of applications and the troubleshooting of any routing issues.

Overview Last year, CNCF reported an extraordinary 300% increase in Kubernetes adoption from 23% in March 2016 to 92% in July 2020. The data clearly outlines Kubernetes as the industry standard for container orchestration. But the study also reports Kubernetes security remains as one of the top 3 challenges. As organizations accelerate their adoption of containers, they must invest in safeguarding this critical infrastructure. MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework tactics include the following: Initial Access.

Overview In this second piece of a 3-part series, we will take a deep dive into the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix of known tactics and techniques. The goal is usually to gain access to other resources, such as other containers or nodes. In containerized environments, they may try to gain access to various resources in the cluster from given access to one container, to the underlying node from a container, or to the cloud environment. It allows containers to send requests to the Kubernetes API server.

An attacker usually strategizes how to infiltrate a cluster and perform damage by following the stages that entail an attack lifecycle. The attacker must progress through each of these stages for the attack to be successful. It may be downloaded from a public image registry (e.g.
