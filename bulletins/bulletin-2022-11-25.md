When it comes to negotiating and managing conflict, Professor Michele Gelfand says it’s time to get creative. Everybody has wants and needs. So what do we do when our priorities compete with those of other people? According to Gelfand, a professor of organizational behavior, negotiations and conflict management are exercises in creative problem-solving, ones where we look for ways to not only get what we want, but for those on the other side of the table to get what they want too.

What’s so great about functional programming anyway? To hear some people talk about functional programming, you&#39;d think they&#39;d joined some kind of cult. They prattle on about how it&#39;s changed the way they think about code.

A more likely answer is 24 bytes. I wrote a little Java program that relies on the jamm … Continue reading What is the size of a byte[] array in Java?

This paper appeared in VLDB2022. It presents the design of OceanBase, a scale-out multitenant relational database deployed on tens of thousands of servers at Alipay.com. The design of OceanBase is not impressive. It looks like OceanBase uses a standard run-off-the-mill Paxos groups architecture. Maybe there are some interesting work going on at integration with storage. Unfortunately, the paper is poorly written. It talks and boasts about many things, some repeatedly.g. OceanBase is multitenant.

I joined Twitter in March, 2007. My first tweet was anything but glorious, “Sitting in Networking class. Not enjoying it.” Ten tweets before receiving my first like. Another fifty before my second. Reading my early tweets, I was confused by this lack of likes. I slowly remembered: likes didn’t exist. Instead there were favorites, bookmarks rather than algorithmic boosts. The absence of replies also felt odd. A month after joining, I tweeted out my first link to a file on the college’s webserver.

Last week, Tailscale hosted a three-day co-work week to prove Tailscale Runs Anywhere I Need (TRAIN) by traversing the Amtrak Coast Starlight line from Emeryville, CA to Seattle, WA. The week included a shared work day in Berkeley, an overnight on the train, a work day from the train’s observatory, and a work day from a lovely Airbnb in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. Shout out to the Amtrak train attendants that joined in on the fun and made our trip spectacular. Tailscalars on a train.

## [Action required: Upgrade Windows clients to v1.32.3](https://tailscale.com/blog/windows-security-vulnerabilities/)


Tailscale has recently been notified of security vulnerabilities in the Tailscale Windows client which allow a malicious website visited by a device running Tailscale to change the Tailscale daemon configuration and access information in the Tailscale local and peer APIs. To patch these vulnerabilities, upgrade Tailscale on your Windows machines to Tailscale v1.32.3 or later , or v1.33.257 or later (unstable). The peer API was also vulnerable to DNS rebinding.32.3 are affected.32.33.32.

For production and hybrid cloud environments, manual deployments with Kubernetes are time consuming and non reusable. As you deploy different applications with similar configuration settings to Kubernetes, you’ll have a large number of YAML files and substantial duplication; this makes the applications difficult to maintain. This is where Helm can help. With Helm, you can deploy complex applications quickly as Helm charts, resulting in increased productivity, scalability, and reusability .0.ip.

It could be a superfluous step that you finally nix. Maybe you decide to revise the format of your weekly team call, or to implement one last quality check that takes minutes but occasionally saves hours.

## [Simplify and automate cost optimization with Autoclass for Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/optimize-your-cloud-storage-spend/)


There is a data explosion challenge that most IT admins and companies are tackling regularly. The cost-effectiveness, durability and scalability make object storage the first choice for unstructured data. Cloud Storage is an object storage service capable of storing data at exabyte scale and easily managing billions, if not trillions, of objects. However, cost optimization for data stored in object storage is a hard problem. In fact, I’d estimate 90% of our data will benefit from Autoclass.

Editor&#39;s note : The ISE Crypto PQC working group is comprised of Google Senior Cryptography Engineers Stefan Kölbl, Rafael Misoczki, and Sophie Schmieg. When you visit a website and the URL starts with HTTPS, you’re relying on a secure public key cryptographic protocol to shield the information you share with the site from casual eavesdroppers. However, as Google Cloud CISO Phil Venables wrote in July , we expect large-scale quantum computers to completely break these algorithms in the future...

## [Using the Open Source Insights dataset to analyze the security and compliance of your dependencies](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/using-the-open-source-insights-dataset/)


Recent security events, like the Log4j issue , underscore the need for security teams to be vigilant in evaluating not only the code written by developers in-house, but also the open source packages that code depends on, and the code that those open source packages depend on, and so on. This web of dependencies forms a dependency graph, in which each node can introduce security vulnerabilities and other surprises. Reviewing all of these dependencies is a complex task for security teams.dev .0.0.
