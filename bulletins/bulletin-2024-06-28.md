## [Run Meetings like a DM](https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2024-06-27-Adventure/)


Everyone loves to rant about meetings and offer pithy advice. &#34;This could have been an email&#34; &#34;Never invite more than 5 people&#34; &#34;If there&#39;s no agenda, don&#39;t show up&#34;. Meetings are (mostly) universally hated, but also necessary to some degree in order for collaboration to function: the problem is that nobody can agree on just how much. I&#39;ve been a manager for decades, with my own strengths and weaknesses. What&#39;s going on? Why is it different? I had no answer at first... Give it a try.

## [Introducing Initiatives](https://linear.app/changelog/2024-06-25-introducing-initiatives)


Introducing Initiatives Today, we are launching a new feature called Initiatives. With Initiatives, you can align projects with larger, strategic product efforts and monitor their progress at scale. Initiatives provide a canonical entry point for your company&#39;s most important streams of work. Initiatives are an evolution of what we set out to achieve with Roadmaps and will directly replace them. A gray indicator appears in the health column when a project within the Initiative lacks an update.

To use the Montreal subway (the Métro), you tap a paper ticket against the turnstile and it opens. The ticket works through a system called NFC, but what&#39;s happening internally? How does the ticket work without a battery? How does it communicate with the turnstile? And how can it be so cheap that you can throw the ticket away after one use? To answer these questions, I opened up a ticket and examined the tiny chip inside. The image below shows the chip inside the ticket, highly magnified.e.e.e.

We&#39;ll start with a visual and intuitive representation of what a projection is. In the following diagram, we have vector b in the usual 3-dimensional space and two possible projections - one onto the z axis, and another onto the x,y plane. The projection of b on the z axis is the shadow cast by b when a flashlight is pointed at it in the direction of the z axis. We&#39;ll see a more formal definition soon. A projection onto the x,y plane is similarly easy to express.

## [How much memory does a call to ‘malloc’  allocates?](https://lemire.me/blog/2024/06/27/how-much-memory-does-a-call-to-malloc-allocates/)


In C, we allocate memory on the heap using the malloc function. Other programming languages like C&#43;&#43; or zig (e.g., std.heap.c_allocator) may call on malloc underneath so it is important to understand how malloc works. Furthermore, the same concepts apply broadly to other memory allocators. In theory, you could allocate just one byte like so: … Continue reading How much memory does a call to ‘malloc’ allocates?

Copying data in software is cheap, but it is not at all free. As you start optimizing your code, you might find that copies become a performance bottleneck. Let me be clear that copies really are cheap. It is often more performant to copy that data than to track the same memory across different threads. … Continue reading Performance tip: avoid unnecessary copies

However, they often end up needing more advanced features and better support than MLflow can provide. MLflow lacks…

You&#39;ve got a wall in your apartment and a couch. You measure the wall with a ruler and get 7 feet, then you measure the couch and get 7 feet. Can you fit the couch against that wall? Maybe. If the two measure is exactly 7 feet than sure, 7 ≤ 7. But you probably didn&#39;t line your measuring stick up perfectly with the couch, and also the stick itself might be a tiny bit long. There&#39;s some uncertainty around the edges, say 1/10th of a foot.9 feet and a maximum of 7.1.9, 7.1). Since 7.1 !&lt; 6. Maybe.

Predrag Gruevski and Chris Krycho joined the show to talk about SemVer. We explore the challenges and the advantages of semantic versioning (aka SemVer), the need for improving the tooling around SemVer, where semantic versioning really shines and where it’s needed, Types and SemVer, whether or not there’s a better way, and why it’s not as simple as just opting out.

One of the biggest problems with the large language models that power chatbots like ChatGPT is that you never know when you can trust them. They can generate clear and cogent prose in response to any question, and much of the information they provide is accurate and useful. But they also hallucinate —in less polite terms, they make stuff up—and those hallucinations are presented in the same clear and cogent prose, leaving it up to the human user to detect the errors.D...

Last week at VLSI Symposium , Intel detailed the manufacturing process that will form the foundation of its foundry service for high-performance data center customers. For the same power consumption, the Intel 3 process results in an 18 percent performance gain over the previous process, Intel 4 . On the company’s roadmap, Intel 3 is the last to use the fin field-effect transistor ( FinFET ) structure, which the company pioneered in 2011. “A lot of external customers don’t do that,” he says.

Simulation plays a critical role in developing new technologies — and technologies that power our world using renewable sources are no exception. The challenge is scaling the amount of energy generated from renewable resources quickly in order to reduce reliance on nonrenewable resources such as oil and natural gas. Engineers address this challenge by using advanced computational simulations to determine design feasibility. Many renewable engineering sources contain multiple physics (e.g.

Imagine it’s 2050 and you’re on a cross-country flight on a new type of airliner, one with no fuel on board. The plane takes off, and you rise above the airport. Instead of climbing to cruising altitude, though, your plane levels out and the engines quiet to a low hum. Is this normal? No one seems to know. Anxious passengers crane their necks to get a better view out their windows. They’re all looking for one thing. Then it appears: a massive antenna array on the horizon. In 2021, the U.S.S.
