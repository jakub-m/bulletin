When I was a young boy, a cousin gifted me a copy of Steely Dan’s greatest hits. In that era of CDs and 56k baud modems, I didn’t have much new music to play, and over the summer I listened to that CD enough that bits and pieces come back to me despite not knowingly listening to a Steely Dan song in at least 25 years. One song in particular, Black Cow , has a lyric that occasionally comes to mind, “You should know / How all the pros play the game / You change your name.

Resilience We can use the standard definition from the Oxford English dictionary to describe resilience: re·sil·ience /rəˈzilyəns/ noun the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness.

Firefox uses a multi-process model for additional security and stability while browsing: Web Content (such as HTML/CSS and Javascript) is rendered in separate processes that are isolated from the rest of the operating system and managed by a privileged parent process. This way, the amount of control gained by an attacker that exploits a bug in a content process is limited.

## [sqlite-utils: a nice way to import data into SQLite for analysis](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/05/12/sqlite-utils--a-nice-way-to-import-data-into-sqlite/)


Hello! This is a quick post about a nice tool I found recently called sqlite-utils , from the tools category . Recently I wanted to do some basic data analysis using data from my Shopify store. So I figured I’d query the Shopify API and import my data into SQLite, and then I could make queries to get the graphs I want. But this seemed like a lot of boring work, like I’d have to write a schema and write a Python program... # (some code to get the `orders` array here) db = sqlite_utils.

Hello! A couple weeks ago I released a new zine called How DNS Works . When I started writing that zine (in, uh, January 2021), I originally had in mind a broader zine on “everything you need to know to own a domain”. So it had a bunch of pages on domain registration, TLS, and email. At the time I thought “I can just explain DNS in like 5 pages, it’s not that complicated, there will be lots of space for other topics about domains”.

## [Faster bitset decoding using Intel AVX-512](https://lemire.me/blog/2022/05/10/faster-bitset-decoding-using-intel-avx-512/)


I refer to “bitset decoding” as the action of finding the positions of the 1s in a stream of bits. For example, given the integer value 0b11011 (or 27 in decimal),  I want to find 0,1,3,4. In my previous post, Fast bitset decoding using Intel AVX-512, I explained how you can use Intel’s new instructions, … Continue reading Faster bitset decoding using Intel AVX-512

In software, we often use ‘bitsets’: you work with arrays of bits to represent sets of small integers. It is a concise and fast data structure. Sometimes you want to go from the bitset (e.g., 0b110011) to the integers (e.g., 0, 1, 5, 6 in this instance). We consider with ‘average’ density (e.g., more than … Continue reading Fast bitset decoding using Intel AVX-512

‘Drift’ is a given in a dynamic software system where code gets outdated the minute it is released. This is true of application code, and in systems where infrastructure is managed as code as well. Drift is a problem for builders and maintainers of these systems as it causes incompatibility issues, brings unpredictability, and makes systems unreliable. Reducing configuration drift is a top priority for system architects and SREs alike. Magalix ensures your systems stay compliant.
