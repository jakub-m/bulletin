## [Highly Available Transactions: Virtues and Limitations](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2022/11/highly-available-transactions-virtues.html)


This is a VLDB 2014 paper from Peter Bailis, Aaron Davidson, Alan Fekete, Ali Ghodsi, Joseph M. Hellerstein, and Ion Stoica. This is a great paper, because it asked an important question that helped advanced our understanding of isolation properties with respect to high-availability. So here is the context. As part of his PhD, Peter Bailis started think about the benefits of relaxed consistency guarantees, and how can we leverage them. AnnaDB is a direct practical follow up to this paper.g. [...

## [An Ultimate Guide to Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control](https://earthly.dev/blog/guide-rolebased-ctrl/)


Kubernetes has many resources and components that must be kept out of reach of certain users and service accounts. Resources such as secrets have to be encrypted and have strict access. If everyone in a company who has access to the cluster is given limitless power when using the cluster; this is dangerous because Kubernetes secrets and keys can be stolen and used inappropriately. Implementing RBAC in Kubernetes is easy. Prerequisites You will need a running cluster and Kubectl.authorization.

#498 – November 14, 2022 In defense of linked lists So, on Twitter, I was talking about a very bad implementation of linked lists written in Rust. From the tone of certain replies, I got the feeling that many people think linked lists are like a joke. I will argue that this is rarely the case after so many hours of doom-scrolling the orange website, the contrarian in me is finally taking over. newsletters Daily Tech Tech Lead Digest C# Digest React Digest

## [The flying wedge.](https://lethain.com/flying-wedge/)


When I worked at Yahoo!, our team needed another engineering manager. We didn’t run a hiring process, or even do interviews. Instead, our Director brought on a colleague he’d worked with before. That new manager soon decided he needed a tech lead on his team. We didn’t run a hiring process, do interviews, or consider candidates on the existing team. Instead, our new manager brought over one of his previous colleagues. This playbook stands at stark odds with the typical scaled company’s approach.

My new servers have been having a little bit of a problem lately. Someone out there has decided to do a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against them. The specific type of attack is an &#34; HTTP flood &#34;. Basically, the client makes as many HTTP requests as it can, as fast as it can. To increase the volume, they also use a wide range of IP addresses. The goal from this type of attack is to overcome the server&#39;s resources, making it unavailable to other users.com and hackerfactor.com .94.

## [Writing a SQL database, take two: Zig and RocksDB](http://notes.eatonphil.com/zigrocks-sql.html)


For my second project while learning Zig, I decided to port an old, minimal SQL database project from Go to Zig. In this post, in ~1700 lines of code (yes, I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s bigger than my usual), we&#39;ll create a basic embedded SQL database in Zig on top of RocksDB. Other than the RocksDB layer it will not use third-party libraries. The code for this project is available on GitHub . Here are a few example interactions we&#39;ll support: $ .

Doing research into a field means comparing a lot of different things in that field. This encourages a lot more people to actually do the comparisons.

Now that Twitter is on a downward spiral I’m rewriting my favorite tweetstorms in a more permanent medium, so here’s the first: why do we have the term “boilerplate code”? It comes from the peculiar interplay of two industrial revolution technologies: steam engines and hot metal typesetting. So let’s start with the steam engine. Steam engines run on steam, produced by a water boiler. The hotter you can get the steam, the more efficiently you can extract energy from it. This is a bad thing.

Tailscale lets you put all your devices on their own private tailnet so they can reach each other, ACLs permitting. Usually that’s nice and comforting, knowing that all your devices can then be isolated from the internet, without any ports needing to be open to the world. Sometimes, though, you need something from the big, scary, non-Tailscale internet to be able to reach your device. Maybe you need to receive a webhook from GitHub. Shockingly, the whole world doesn’t use Tailscale.conf file.ts.

A recent C&#43;&#43; standard (C&#43;&#43;17) introduced new functions to parse floating-point numbers std::from_chars, from strings (e.g., ASCII text) to binary numbers. How should such a function parse values that cannot be represented exactly? The specification states that the resulting value rounded to nearest. This means that 1.0000000000000000001 and 0.999999999999999999 become exactly 1.0. The C language has … Continue reading Rounding modes: std::from_chars versus strtod/strtof

For example, you can have the number 1.0 and the number 1e-100 (1 over 10 to the power 100). They can both be represented using standard IEEE floating-point numbers.
