Go straight to [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/). If there is nothing new on HS, come back here. The _bulletin_ was created for those grim times of HS without regular update.

_Bulletin_ is updated weekly at Fridays. Friday is hardcoded.

The [list of feeds][ref_feeds] comes from my [bookmarks][ref_tw].
