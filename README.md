Go straight to [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/). If there is nothing new on HS, come back here. The _bulletin_ was created for the grim times of HS without regular update.

_Bulletin_ is updated weekly at Fridays. Friday is hardcoded.

[**The most recent _bulletin_ here!**][ref_current]

The [list of feeds][ref_feeds] comes from my [bookmarks][ref_tw].

# TODO

- style - mark visited sites
- allow retrieving past bulletins (e.g. n - 1)
- BUG: some feeds result in zero time, why (e.g. this https://ahelwer.ca/index.xml)
- BUG: reference day changes based on interval, clarify
- for feeds that are hard to parse, consider top-n feeds once a month. better than nothing. or reminders at the bottom of the bulletin.
