The [list of feeds][ref_feeds] comes from my [bookmarks][ref_tw].

# TODO

- hanndle partial failure for a failing single feed
- concurrent downloads
- some [feeds][ref_feeds] are not handled
- some feeds result in zero time, why (e.g. this https://ahelwer.ca/index.xml)
- fix how age is calculated (not "now" but reference time)
